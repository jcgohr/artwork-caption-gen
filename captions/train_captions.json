The woman is reclining on a bed, with her legs spread apart and her arms resting on her stomach. She is wearing a necklace and a bracelet, and has a flower in her hair. The servant is standing next to the bed, holding a bouquet of flowers. The painting is considered controversial because of its depiction of a nude woman, and the fact that the servant is black. The painting is now in the Mus. E d'Orsay in Paris. The painting is a masterpiece of Realism, and it is considered one of the most important works of art in the history of Western art.
