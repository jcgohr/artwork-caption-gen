125	The back main (central) panel represents Christ enthroned flanked by angels with a kneeling Cardinal Stefaneschi at his right foot. In the left panel we see the crucifixion of Peter, and on the right is the beheading of St. Paul. The predella depicts the Virgin and Child flanked by angels in the center and standing figures of the 12 apostles at the sides. The central panel of the back of the altarpiece duplicated the apse mosaic for those who could not see it (because they sat with their backs to it), while the side panels introduced narratives. It was normal for double-sided altarpieces in this period to have an iconic image on the front and narrative images on the back. Stefaneschi is dressed in full ceremonial costume as a cardinal on the front, appropriate for the "public" face of the altarpiece and is introduced to St. Peter by St. George.	The image features a large painting of Jesus and his disciples. The painting is divided into four sections, each depicting a different scene. The first section shows Jesus and his disciples, while the second section displays a scene of Jesus and Mary.

126	The painting is a complex arrangement exalting the role of Aquinas as a scholar of religious knowledge, his placement among the Four Evangelists and philosophers. In the center of the panel, the largest figure is the seated tonsured monk St Thomas Aquinas, below a Christ inside a mandorla. Linear rays tie his work to the Four Evangelists and Moses and St Paul above the gilded circle. Flanking him are Aristotle and Plato. Below the feet of Aquinas is a dejected Averroes, horizontal and looks away with book inverted.	The image features a man dressed in a black robe, holding a book in his hands. He is surrounded by several other people, some of whom are also holding books. The scene appears to be a religious gathering or a study session, with the man in the black robe possibly being a religious figure or a teacher. The people in the image are engaged in various activities, such as reading, writing, or discussing, creating a lively atmosphere.	0.20967741935483872	0.24074074074074073	0.22413792605826408	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.1935483870967742	0.2222222222222222	0.20689654674791927	0.7620933055877686	0.7333204746246338	0.7474300861358643	0.0	0.16649323621227888
145	The work is composed of a large central panel depicting the Annunciation, and two side panels with St. Ansanus (left), and female saint, generarally identified with St. Maxima or St. Margaret, in the right, and four tondos in the cusps: Jeremiah, Ezechiel, Isiah and Daniel. The Annunciation shows the archangel Gabriel entering the house of the Virgin Mary to tell her that she will soon bear the child Jesus, whose name means "savior". Gabriel holds an olive branch in his hand, a traditional symbol of peace, while pointing at the Holy Ghost's dove with the other. The dove is descending from heaven, from the center of the mandorla of eight angels above, about to enter the Virgin's right ear. The angel's mantle shows a detailed "tartar cloth" pattern and fine gilt feathers. Mary, sitting on a throne, is portrayed at the moment that she is startled out of her reading, reacting with a graceful and composed reluctance, looking with surprise at the celestial messenger. Her dress has an arabesque-like pattern. At the sides, the two patrons saints of the cathedral are separated by the central scene by two decorate twisting columns. The background, completely gilt, has a vase of lilies, an allegory of purity often associated to the Virgin Mary. The use of a Gothic line, plus such realistic elements as the book, the vase, the throne, the pavement in perspective, the realistic action of the two figures and their subtle nuances of character are a substantial detachment from the bi-dimensionality typical of Byzantine art.	The image features a painting of a woman sitting on a bench, with a man kneeling in front of her. The woman is holding a book, and there is a bird nearby. The painting is set in a beautifully decorated environment, with a gold background and intricate details. The scene appears to be a religious or spiritual setting, with the woman possibly representing Mary.	0.09937888198757763	0.37209302325581395	0.15686274177095355	0.024896265560165973	0.0967741935483871	0.0396039571410213	0.09937888198757763	0.37209302325581395	0.15686274177095355	0.8135284185409546	0.7289160490036011	0.7689014673233032	0.0	0.09187939038199455

151	It displays the gilded, decorated background typical of Byzantine devotional paintings, while Mary is dressed in a blue robe with gold lined edging. He is burly, and far too large for a newborn child. Mary is described by scholars as an Eleusa icon because of the tender manner in which the child is nestled against her cheek, setting the image as an intimate portrayal of the bond between mother and child. Her head is tilted towards her son and embraces his forehead and cheek almost as if in a kiss, while her arms warmly cradle him. He has one leg bent and another extended towards her, while his right arm is held upright and intimately holds her chin from below. A number of oddities in the different versions indicate that the many Italian versions came from a single source; primarily the closeness of the two figures' faces, their seeming embrace, as well as the unusual concentration of the child's facial features in a small portion of his head, which gives him an unusually long forehead.	The image depicts a woman holding a baby in her arms. The woman is wearing a gold and red dress, and she is positioned in the center of the scene. The baby is being held close to her chest, and the woman appears to be looking down at the child. The scene is set against a backdrop of gold and red colors, giving it a warm and inviting atmosphere.	0.11016949152542373	0.30952380952380953	0.1624999961281251	0.023952095808383235	0.06060606060606061	0.034334759888007264	0.1016949152542373	0.2857142857142857	0.14999999612812512	0.820945143699646	0.745493471622467	0.7814021110534668	0.0	0.1515242071560753
159	The work portrays six trees along a riverbank, a metaphor for the principled seclusion of virtuous gentlemen in an era of violent upheaval and foreign occupation. The result was a sparse landscape in which six old trees stand on a small bank in the lower foreground, across an expanse of water from some distant hills in the background.	The image is a painting of a forest with trees and a body of water. The trees are depicted in various stages of growth, with some appearing to be dead. The painting is done in black ink, giving it a more dramatic and artistic appearance. The scene is set against a backdrop of mountains, adding to the overall beauty of the landscape.	0.22727272727272727	0.23809523809523808	0.232558134537588	0.017857142857142856	0.01639344262295082	0.01709401210314997	0.20454545454545456	0.21428571428571427	0.20930232058409964	0.795255184173584	0.7777721881866455	0.7864165306091309	0.0	0.23035163217349452

The landscape contains buildings that resembles those in Jerusalem. The sky above the city contains a small passage showing a flock of birds, the earliest depiction in Flemish painting, although seen again in the "Hermits" panel of the Ghent Altarpiece.	The image depicts a group of four women dressed in red and white robes, standing together and holding books. They appear to be nuns, and they are all wearing veils. The women are positioned in a line, with each woman holding a book in her hands.

The three arches are decorated with vegetable motifs; over them are three panels (whose upper frame is lost), containing the paintings, from the left, of the Angel of the Annunciation, the Blessing Christ between Cherubims and the Annunciation. At the side are two piers with twisting columns on the edges, with paintings of prophets. In the lower part is the predella, with six small paintings of the Episodes of the Lives of St. Benedict and St. Bernard of Clairvaux. The central painting within the three arcades shows the Coronation of the Virgin set in Paradise (alluded by the blue starred belts), with two rows of saints at the sides and a large number of angels behind the throne of Jesus and the Madonna.	The image features a large painting of a religious scene, depicting a group of people gathered around a man and a woman. The man and woman are positioned in the center of the painting, with the man appearing to be kissing the woman. The painting is set against a backdrop of a building, possibly a church.  There are numerous people in the painting, with some standing closer to the man and woman, while others are positioned further away. The people in the painting are of various sizes and are spread throughout the scene, creating a sense of depth and complexity.	0.1348314606741573	0.22641509433962265	0.1690140798284072	0.022388059701492536	0.03409090909090909	0.027027022241702007	0.1348314606741573	0.22641509433962265	0.1690140798284072	0.7859970927238464	0.7460517287254333	0.7655036449432373	0.0	0.1783398184176394
217	The scene is a combination of the traditional iconography of the Nativity of Jesus in art and that of the Madonna of Humility, with Mary portrayed in the foreground while sitting on a lawn. In the background are also Joseph (left, sleeping in order to underline his marginal role in the birth of Jesus), the hut with the donkey and the ox and, farther behind, the annunciation to the shepherds. Typical examples of Gentile's attention to detail are the lawn in the foreground and the rendering of the decoration of Jesus' sheet.	The image features a painting of a woman, possibly Mary, holding a baby. She is surrounded by several other figures, including a man and a horse. The woman appears to be praying, with her hands clasped together. The painting is set against a backdrop of a mountainous landscape.	0.12280701754385964	0.1891891891891892	0.14893616543911287	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.12280701754385964	0.1891891891891892	0.14893616543911287	0.7982624173164368	0.756172776222229	0.776647686958313	0.0	0.10080645161290323
291	The central group with the Madonna and Child is surrounded by eight adoring angels depicted in smaller size. The saints Thomas of Aquino, Barnabas, Dominic and Peter of Verona are at the sides: these were three saints of the Dominican Order (the same owning the convent) and the namesake of  Barnaba degli The naked Child is shown while grasping two flowers: a white rose, symbol of purity, and a red one, a forecast of his future passion connected with the Eucharist: the panel was in fact painted for the church's high altar, where the celebration of this sacrament occurs.	The image depicts a painting of a group of people, including a woman and a baby, with a large statue of Mary in the center. The people are gathered around the statue, with some standing closer to the statue and others further away. The painting is set in a beautiful outdoor setting, with a bench visible in the foreground.

298	Among the most common subjects of painting in churches, it is found more often on walls. In the top centre of the picture, Christ sits in judgement on a white throne surrounded by angels, Mary, John, and the saints. Christ is shown as judge of the living and dead, his left hand pointing down to Hell, his right up to Heaven. On Christ's right hand is paradise, with angels leading the saved through a beautiful garden into a shining city. In the middle are the broken tombs of the risen dead, come out of their graves to be finally judged. On Christ's left demons drive the damned into Hell, where the wicked are tormented. At the very bottom Satan chews on three of the damned, and grasps two others.	The image depicts a large, intricate painting of a woman, possibly Mary, surrounded by a crowd of people. The painting is set against a blue background, and the woman is positioned in the center of the scene. The people surrounding her are of various sizes and are spread throughout the painting, creating a sense of depth and complexity. The painting is reminiscent of a stained glass window, with the colors and details of the people and the woman's clothing adding to the overall beauty of the artwork.	0.14606741573033707	0.24528301886792453	0.18309858687066072	0.024390243902439025	0.0375	0.029556645470650386	0.12359550561797752	0.20754716981132076	0.15492957278615366	0.7824166417121887	0.7430512309074402	0.7622260451316833	0.0	0.2007372805737054
306	Probably executed between c. 1438–40, it depicts the Virgin Mary holding the Child Jesus in a Gothic cathedral. Mary is presented as Queen of Heaven wearing a jewel-studded crown, cradling a playful child Christ who gazes at her and grips the hem of her red dress in a manner that recalls the 13th-century Byzantine tradition of the Eleusa icon (Virgin of Tenderness). Tracery in the arch at the rear of the nave contains wooden carvings depicting episodes from Mary's life, while a faux bois sculpture in a niche shows her holding the child in a similar pose. In a doorway to the right, two angels sing psalms from a hymn book. The panel contains closely observed beams of light flooding through the cathedral's windows. It illuminates the interior before culminating in two pools on the floor. On her head is an elaborately tiered and jeweled crown and in her arms she carries the infant Jesus, his feet resting on her left hand. Swaddled in a white cloth from hips trailing down beyond his feet, his hand rests on her neckline clutching the jeweled hem of his mother's dress. Further depictions of Mary are found in the church background. They include a statue of the Virgin and Child positioned between two lit candles in the choir screen behind the main figures, and to the right two angels stand in the choir singing her praises (perhaps singing the hymn inscribed on the frame). Above her is an annunciation relief, and in the recessed bay a relief depicting her coronation; the crucifixion is shown on the rood. Several different building phases can be seen in the arched gallery, while the choral balcony and transept are depicted in a more contemporary style than the nave. Closely detailed beams of light spill through the high windows and illuminate the interior, filling the portal and flowing across the tiled floors before it hits the clerestory windows. Shadows cast by the cathedral can be seen across the choir steps and near aisle.	The image features a woman dressed in a blue gown, holding a baby in her arms. She is wearing a crown, which adds a regal touch to the scene. The woman is standing in a hallway, surrounded by several other people. The overall atmosphere of the image suggests a sense of importance or a special occasion.	0.06598984771573604	0.325	0.10970463854439289	0.019801980198019802	0.1111111111111111	0.03361344281053618	0.06598984771573604	0.325	0.10970463854439289	0.8094971776008606	0.7125420570373535	0.7579315900802612	0.0	0.057932263814616754
313	The Madonna of Humility, with the Virgin sitting on a cushion over the ground, was a common theme in early 15th century western  painting. She is holding the Child on her knees, above a richly decorated gilt cloth.	The image features a beautiful painting of a woman holding a baby. The woman is wearing a black dress and is positioned in the center of the painting. The baby is lying in her arms, and the woman appears to be cradling the child.

314	The painting depicts the Madonna with Child crowned by two flying angels, sitting inside a rose garden in typical late Gothic style. The painter put a great attention in the representation of vegetables and birds, including the quail in the foreground, which gives its name to the painting. The heavenly appearance of the scene is enhanced by the gilt background.	The image depicts a beautiful painting of a mother holding her child. The mother is wearing a blue dress, and the child is being held close to her chest. The painting is set against a backdrop of flowers, adding a touch of elegance to the scene. The mother and child are surrounded by a variety of birds, which are scattered throughout the painting, adding a sense of life and movement to the artwork.	0.2826086956521739	0.3023255813953488	0.29213482646635525	0.05172413793103448	0.043478260869565216	0.04724408952569958	0.2826086956521739	0.3023255813953488	0.29213482646635525	0.8176195025444031	0.8068283200263977	0.8121880888938904	0.0	0.2862497024113186
319	The three panels represent, from left to right, the donors kneeling in prayer in a garden, the moment of the Annunciation to Mary, which is set in a contemporary, domestic setting, and Saint Joseph, a carpenter with the tools of his trade. The many elements of religious symbolism include the lily and fountain (symbolising the purity of Mary), and the Holy Spirit represented by the rays of light coming falling from the left hand window. The wings contain views of the city of Liège, in today's Belgium.	The image depicts a painting of two women, one dressed in red and the other in blue, sitting together in a room. They are surrounded by various objects, including a dining table, a chair, a vase, and a bowl. The room also features a fireplace, adding warmth and coziness to the scene. The women appear to be engaged in conversation or enjoying each other's company.	0.13333333333333333	0.16326530612244897	0.14678898587660988	0.023809523809523808	0.03125	0.02702702211833544	0.13333333333333333	0.16326530612244897	0.14678898587660988	0.7671945095062256	0.7332533597946167	0.7498400211334229	0.0	0.16582914572864324
344	Portrait of a Fat Man (or Portrait of a Stout Man or Portrait of Robert de Masmines) are names given to two near-identical oil on panel paintings attributed to the Early Netherlandish artist Robert Campin. The man has an alert appearance and intelligent, reasoned eyes, and the close cropping against a light coloured background seems deliberate, probably intended to convey the weight of his personal presence and charisma.	The image features a man with a beard and mustache, wearing a brown robe. He appears to be a religious figure, possibly a monk, with a stern expression on his face. The man is looking directly at the viewer, capturing their attention. The robe he is wearing is brown, and his beard and mustache are clearly visible.	0.16981132075471697	0.225	0.19354838219447348	0.015625	0.018518518518518517	0.016949147578283554	0.16981132075471697	0.225	0.19354838219447348	0.7767758369445801	0.7259734869003296	0.7505159378051758	0.0	0.1813544946768631
347	The painting is part of a cycle on the life of Saint Peter, and describes a scene from the Gospel of Matthew, in which Jesus directs Peter to find a coin in the mouth of a fish in order to pay the temple tax.	The image depicts a group of people, including Jesus, gathered together in a mountainous area. The people are dressed in various attire, with some wearing red and others wearing blue. The scene appears to be a religious gathering or a painting of a historical event. The people are standing close to each other, with some of them holding hands, creating a sense of unity and connection.	0.25	0.1702127659574468	0.20253164074987992	0.023809523809523808	0.016129032258064516	0.019230764415681677	0.21875	0.14893617021276595	0.1772151850536774	0.7155846357345581	0.7457123398780823	0.730337917804718	0.0	0.2309236947791165
354	Head of a Walrus (German: Kopf eines Walrosses) is a 1521 pen drawing and watercolour by the German artist Albrecht Dürer. it looks more like a hairless puppy with tusks.	The image features a large, detailed drawing of a tiger with its mouth open. The tiger's mouth is filled with teeth, and its tongue is sticking out. The drawing is quite intricate, capturing the tiger's features and expressions. The tiger appears to be the main focus of the image, with its mouth being the most prominent element.	0.25	0.19444444444444445	0.21874999507812512	0.034482758620689655	0.018518518518518517	0.024096380995791245	0.25	0.19444444444444445	0.21874999507812512	0.7380770444869995	0.7031701803207397	0.7202009558677673	0.0	0.15706806282722513
356	The central panel shows the Madonna enthroned with two angels and the child Jesus eating some vine, as a symbol of the Eucharist. The halo of the Madonna bears the Shahada written backwards. The left panel depicts Saint Bartholomew and Saint Blaise, and the right panel depicts Saint Anthony and Saint Juvenal (Giovenale). The left and right panels show a marked influence of 14th century models, while the complex perspective of the centre panel would have been something new for its time.	The image is a painting of a woman holding a baby, surrounded by other people. The woman is positioned in the center of the painting, and the baby is held close to her. There are several other people in the painting, some of them standing and others sitting.

361	It depicts the expulsion of Adam and Eve from the garden of Eden, from the biblical Book of Genesis chapter 3, albeit with a few differences from the canonical account.	The image features a painting of three naked men, each with their hands on their faces. The men are depicted in various positions, with one man standing on the left side of the painting, another in the middle, and the third on the right side. The men are all looking up, possibly at a celestial event or a symbolic representation.

377	But for one, the angels, very delicate in their tender forms and pale, gentle colouring, are from the more Gothic brush of Masolino; the angel in the upper right hand curve reveals the hand of Masaccio. The figure of St. Anne is much worn and hence to be judged with difficulty, but her hand, which seems to explore the depth of the picture-space, may well be an invention of Masaccio.	The image features a beautiful painting of a woman holding a baby. The woman is wearing a blue dress and is surrounded by several angels, some of which are positioned above her and others below her. The scene is set in a church, with the woman and baby at the center of attention. The painting captures the essence of love and care, as the woman nurtures her child in the presence of the angels.	0.2037037037037037	0.24444444444444444	0.22222221726354463	0.029411764705882353	0.027777777777777776	0.028571423575511075	0.14814814814814814	0.17777777777777778	0.16161615665748408	0.7671800851821899	0.7262158393859863	0.7461361289024353	0.0	0.19350811485642946
397	As in the Annunciation of Cortona, the pictured surface is divided in three parts (the garden, the Angel's arch and the Virgin's arch), but the vanishing point is inside the home and not outside, like the Annunciation of San Giovanni, focusing the viewer's attention on the Annunciation. As in the other two works, they are moving in a flowered garden representing the virginity of Mary ("hortus conclusus"), inhabited by a multitude of plants and seedlings painted with great accuracy. Between the species with symbolic values, we can recognise the palm, representing the future martyrdom of Christ, and the red roses referring the blood of the Passion. The presence of Adam and Eve evidences the cycle of the human damnation, recomposed with the deliverance in Christ made possible by the accept of Mary. From the high-left a ray of divine light illuminates, through the dove of Holy Spirit, the Virgin, who bends accepting his duty submissively. She's sitting on a seat covered with a rich drape acting as carpet too, and she has on her knees an open book, symbol of the happening Scriptures. The Angel has a similar pose and vest to the work of San Giovanni, even if his figure appears more static and the folds of the vest are more schematic, maybe due to the brush strokes of a collaborator. The scene is set under a renaissance portico with the light arches stretched with wisdom on perspective, which remember the architecture of Michelozzo.	The painting depicts an angel and a woman, possibly Mary, in a religious context. The angel is kneeling down and touching the woman's face, while the woman is sitting on a bench. The scene is set in a room with a dining table and a chair. The painting is quite detailed, with the figures and the room's elements being well-represented.	0.07741935483870968	0.3076923076923077	0.1237113369938358	0.039473684210526314	0.16071428571428573	0.06338027852410252	0.07096774193548387	0.28205128205128205	0.11340205864332031	0.8225780129432678	0.7324448823928833	0.7748992443084717	0.004142755095550591	0.09765708210846966
413	The picture depicts the Annunciation by the Archangel Gabriel to the Virgin Mary that she will bear the son of God She modestly draws back and responds, ECCE ANCILLA DÑI or "Behold the handmaiden of the Lord". The Seven gifts of the Holy Spirit descend to her on seven rays of light from the upper window to the left, with the dove symbolizing the Holy Spirit following the same path; "This is the moment God's plan for salvation is set in motion.	The image depicts a beautiful scene of two women dressed in medieval attire, with one woman kneeling and the other standing. The woman kneeling is holding a book, possibly a Bible, while the standing woman is holding a cross. The scene appears to be set in a church, with stained glass windows in the background. The women are surrounded by a few books, which are placed on the floor and on a surface nearby.

415	Conversely from other Annunciations of Fra Angelico, the vanishing point of perspective is in focus monofocal the left of the table.	The image depicts a painting of two women, one dressed in pink and the other in blue, standing next to each other. They are both holding books, possibly religious texts, and appear to be engaged in a conversation. The painting is set in a room with a bench in the background.  In addition to the two main women, there are several other people in the scene, some of whom are standing closer to the bench, while others are positioned further away. The presence of multiple people in the painting suggests that it might be a gathering or a social event.	0.29411764705882354	0.078125	0.12345678680688929	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.23529411764705882	0.0625	0.09876542878219795	0.6870794296264648	0.7198145985603333	0.7030662298202515	0.0	0.18808777429467086
502	It is executed in gold and silver stylus, pen and brush and lead slate pencil. It is in poor condition, being covered in yellowish varnish which has damaged both the paper and drawing. It shows a mass of people gather around a crucifixion scene, with Christ's followers grieving in the foreground (though they are thinly described compared to the other figures), soldiers and spectators hanging around in the mid-ground and a portrayal of three crucified bodies in the upper-ground. Both works contain a number of similarly depicted and positions figures, share the same steep perspective, with the city of Jerusalem can be seen in the distance, though at a much lower angle here than in the finished diptych.	The image is a painting of a religious scene, featuring a large crowd of people gathered around a cross. The painting is divided into two sections, with the left side depicting a group of people standing around the cross, while the right side shows a group of people kneeling in front of the cross. The painting also includes a horse, which is located in the lower left section of the image. The overall atmosphere of the painting is one of reverence and devotion.	0.15294117647058825	0.2826086956521739	0.19847327788590421	0.044642857142857144	0.0684931506849315	0.054054049276260466	0.12941176470588237	0.2391304347826087	0.16793892674086605	0.8162758350372314	0.7559100389480591	0.7849340438842773	0.0	0.19834747439647096
504	It portrays Christ supported by several people, with Mary Magdalene keeping his feet, as a symbol of human repention. A figure on the right, with a red hat, is showing the cross' nails and the horns crown, symbols of passion and sacrifice. Mary, wearing a dark dress, is shown  in the traditional gesture of keeping hands joined.	The image depicts a scene of a man being crucified, surrounded by a crowd of people. The man is hanging on a cross, with several people standing around him, some of them wearing red hats. The crowd appears to be composed of various individuals, some of whom are closer to the man on the cross, while others are further away. The scene captures the emotional intensity of the moment, as the people gather to witness the crucifixion.	0.2391304347826087	0.22448979591836735	0.23157894237340734	0.017857142857142856	0.013333333333333334	0.015267170677701003	0.13043478260869565	0.12244897959183673	0.12631578447867056	0.7946583032608032	0.7992400527000427	0.7969425916671753	0.0	0.2836479201627634
517	Now in the Prado, Madrid, it depicts a seated and serene Virgin Mary dressed in a long, flowing red robe lined with gold-coloured thread. She cradles the child Jesus who sits on her lap, playfully leafing backwards through a holy book or manuscript on which both figures' gazes rest. Christ appears much older than in most contemporary paintings of this kind. He is far from an infant, and is very realistically and physically rendered. Mary is shown in a long, red, hooded robe and white headdress, with the Child Jesus in a white shirt seated on her lap. He curiously leafs through and crumples the pages of a book perched on his mother's knee. The book is placed at the very center of the panel, symbolising the centrality of the divine Word in Christian belief. An angel in dark grey dress hovers above Mary's head, holding a pearl-encrusted crown destined for her upon her assumption as Queen of Heaven. Mary's long robe swirls around the pictorial space, obscuring her throne and eventually falling at the support by her feet. They are framed by a sculpted niche or apse with Gothic tracery similar to that found in van der Weyden's Descent from the Cross. The curved arches of the niche echo the lines of her figure as she bends protectively over the child. These curved lines and warm colours give the work its sense of internal harmony. Acres believes that the book is central to the understanding of the painting, and notes its perfect centrality in the panel; it is the focus of both figures' gazes and hands, and Christ is apparently leafing backwards through the pages, towards the beginning. While Christ's right hand holds a number of parchments scrunched together and he pays no attention to them, his more careful left hand is about to open the lower left corner of the open page. If it is reasonably assumed that the book held open on Mary's lap is facing towards her, it seems the child is leafing backwards through the pages.	The image features a woman sitting on a chair, holding a baby in her arms. The woman is wearing a red dress, and the baby is positioned close to her. The woman is also holding a book, which appears to be a Bible. The scene captures a tender moment between the woman and the baby, showcasing the love and care she provides.	0.06965174129353234	0.358974358974359	0.11666666394479173	0.0031645569620253164	0.017543859649122806	0.005361927705655714	0.06467661691542288	0.3333333333333333	0.1083333306114584	0.8191536664962769	0.7219703197479248	0.7674977779388428	0.0	0.06992748670832769
531	It is believed that the panel shows portraits of several contemporary figures such as Philip the Good, and possibly the artists Hubert and Jan van Eyck themselves.	The image is a painting of a group of people riding horses. There are several horses in the scene, with some riders sitting on the horses and others standing nearby. The people are wearing various types of clothing, and some of them are holding items such as a book and a cup. The painting captures the essence of a gathering or a celebration, with the riders and horses spread across the scene.	0.2916666666666667	0.1590909090909091	0.2058823483737025	0.038461538461538464	0.014285714285714285	0.020833329383681303	0.2916666666666667	0.1590909090909091	0.2058823483737025	0.7425858378410339	0.7214199304580688	0.7318499088287354	0.0	0.21701388888888892
551	The sitter has not been identified, but his highly individual features suggest a historical person rather than the hypothetical ideal usual at the time in northern Renaissance portraiture; his slight and unassuming torso is contrasted with a sophisticated facial expression. The man sits before an imitation parapet with three sets of painted inscriptions, each rendered to look as if chiselled or scratched into stone. The parapet dominates the portrait, and his head seems oversized compared to his upper body.	The image features a man wearing a red robe and a green hood, possibly a monk. He is holding a book in his hand, possibly a Bible. The man appears to be looking at the camera, and his expression suggests a sense of authority or wisdom. The scene is set against a backdrop of a building, which adds to the overall atmosphere of the image.	0.208955223880597	0.3181818181818182	0.2522522474669265	0.038461538461538464	0.047619047619047616	0.04255318654594897	0.19402985074626866	0.29545454545454547	0.23423422944890848	0.7936391830444336	0.7585989236831665	0.7757235169410706	0.0	0.20606391123081463
558	The scene depicts the Virgin Mary crowned by a hovering Angel while she presents the Infant Jesus to Rolin. It is set within a spacious loggia with a rich decoration of columns and bas-reliefs. In the background is a landscape with a city on a river, probably intended to be Autun in Burgundy, Rolin's hometown. A wide range of well detailed palaces, churches, an island, a towered bridge, hills and fields is portrayed, subject to a uniform light. Perhaps some of the Chancellor's many landholdings around Autun are included in the vista. A haze covers a mountain range in the far distance. The small garden with many flowers identifiable (including lilies, irises, paeonies and roses), visible just outside the columns, symbolizes Mary's virtues. Beyond, two male figures wearing chaperons are looking through the crenellations of what looks to be a fortified balcony or bridge. The figure on the right wears a similar red chaperon to the probable van Eyck self-portrait in the National Gallery, London. Near to them are two peacocks, symbols both of immortality and of pride, to which even a powerful man as Rolin might succumb. The chancellor, whose strong character is well rendered by the artist, is wearing a fur-lined, elegant garment; the Virgin, the same size as Rolin (rather a novelty in comparison to the Gothic painting tradition), is instead covered by a red mantle. The Infant Jesus holds a cross in his left hand. The perfectionist rendering of details and textures, such as the capitals, the checquered pavement, the goldwork of the angel's crown or the garments is characteristic of Jan van Eyck's work, of which this is one of the finest examples. Comparison of the floor-tiles with other elements shows that the figures are only about six feet from the columned loggia screen, and that Rolin might have to squeeze himself through the opening to get out that way.	The image depicts a painting of a medieval scene, featuring a man and a woman sitting next to each other. The woman is holding a baby, and the man is praying. The painting is set in a courtyard, with a book visible in the scene. The overall atmosphere of the painting suggests a religious or spiritual theme.	0.085	0.4722222222222222	0.1440677940247056	0.013289036544850499	0.07142857142857142	0.022408960940298	0.075	0.4166666666666667	0.1271186414823327	0.8161524534225464	0.7020058035850525	0.7547879219055176	0.0	0.0658682634730539
561	The Virgin seated on a cushion placed directly on the ground with the child standing on her lap, holds a vase in her left hand which contains roses and a lily, symbols of motherhood and purity. The Child, who is also holding a lily, rests his forehead on his mother's cheek. They are set under a cloth of honour made of gold and black embroidered brocade held by three angels, while two more angels are seated on the ground playing an organ and a lute. The monumental figures, the splendour of the clothes, the modulated light and the use of the blue colour place this panel in the purest fifteenth-century Italian style.	The image features a beautiful woman sitting on a chair, holding a baby in her arms. The woman is wearing a blue dress and is surrounded by a few decorative elements. There are two vases in the scene, one placed near the woman and the other further away. Additionally, there are two birds in the image, one near the top left corner and the other in the top right corner. The overall atmosphere of the scene is serene and peaceful.	0.20512820512820512	0.32	0.24999999523925787	0.05714285714285714	0.08333333333333333	0.0677966053432925	0.1794871794871795	0.28	0.21874999523925792	0.7940991520881653	0.7752273082733154	0.7845497727394104	0.0	0.2105281491726858
577	It shows a woman with the pale skin, high cheek bones and oval eyelids typical of the idealised portraits of noble women of the period. She is identifiable as the Magdalen from the jar of ointment placed in the foreground, which is her traditional attribute in Christian art. She is presented as completely absorbed in her reading, a model of the contemplative life, repentant and absolved of past sins. Iconography of the Magdalen commonly shows her with a book, in a moment of reflection, in tears, or with eyes averted. The background of the painting had been overpainted with a thick layer of brown paint. A cleaning between 1955 and 1956 revealed the figure standing behind the Magdalene and the kneeling figure with its bare foot protruding in front of her, with a landscape visible through a window. The figure above her has been identified as belonging to a fragment in the Museu Calouste Gulbenkian, Lisbon, which shows the head of Saint Joseph, while another Lisbon fragment, showing what is believed to be Saint Catherine of Alexandria, is thought to be from the same larger work. The drawing shows that The Magdalen occupied the lower right-hand corner of the altarpiece. Mary is shown by van der Weyden as youthful, sitting in quiet piety with her head tilted and eyes modestly averted from the viewer. She is absorbed in her reading of a holy book, the covers of which include a chemise of white cloth, a common form of protective binding. Four coloured cloth bookmarks are tied to a gold bar near the top of the spine. It was rare for contemporary portraits to show women reading, and if the model herself could read then she was likely from a noble family. She is seated on a red cushion and rests her back against a wooden sideboard. By her feet is her usual attribute of an alabaster jar; in the Gospels she brought spices to the tomb of Jesus. The view through the window is of a distant canal, with an archer atop the garden wall and a figure walking on the other side of the water, whose reflection shows in the water. She wears a green robe; in medieval art the Magdalene is usually depicted naked (sometimes clad only in her long hair) or in richly coloured dress, typically red, blue or green, almost never in white. Her robe is tightly pulled below her bust by a blue sash, while the gold brocade of her underskirt is adorned by a jewelled hem. Her lips are painted with a shades of vermilion, white and red which are mixed into each other to give a transparent look at the edges. The fur lining of her dress is painted in a range of greys running from almost pure white to pure black. Rogier gave the fur a textured look by painting stripes parallel to the line of the dress and then feathering the paint before it dried. The gold on the cloth is rendered with a variety of impasto, grid and dots of varying colour and size. Many of the objects around her are also closely detailed, in particular the wooden floor and nails, the folds of the Magdalene's dress, the costume of the figures in the exterior and the beads of Joseph's rosary. One critic wrote that the areas of the floor and most of the cupboard behind her seem unfinished and "much too narrow and papery in effect". A number of objects placed on the cupboard are now barely visible save for their bases. The object on the right seated on legs alongside a box is likely a small pitcher, possibly a reliquary. A moulding to the left of the cupboard may represent a doorway.	The image depicts a woman sitting on the floor, reading a book. She is surrounded by a few other people, with one person standing behind her and another person sitting on a chair nearby. The woman is wearing a green dress and appears to be focused on her reading. The scene takes place in a room with a bed in the background.	0.07076923076923076	0.5476190476190477	0.12534059742814932	0.024390243902439025	0.23333333333333334	0.04416403614126926	0.06769230769230769	0.5238095238095238	0.11989100614749536	0.8183847665786743	0.7173847556114197	0.7645636200904846	0.0	0.046392577187649976
582	Its three lower panels show the Nativity of the Virgin, whilst the three upper panels (from left to right) show Death of the Virgin, Madonna of Humility and Burial of the Virgin.	The image depicts a painting of a group of people, including a woman and a baby, gathered in a room. The painting is set in a building with a large archway, and the people are engaged in various activities. Some are sitting, while others are standing, and a few are holding items such as a bowl and a book. The scene appears to be a lively gathering or a social event, with the individuals interacting and enjoying each other's company.	0.19047619047619047	0.07407407407407407	0.10666666263466681	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.19047619047619047	0.07407407407407407	0.10666666263466681	0.6992014646530151	0.7161285877227783	0.7075638175010681	0.0	0.15330188679245282
589	Portrait of a Man with a Blue Chaperon (or Portrait of a Man with a Blue Hood, earlier Portrait of a Jeweler or Man with a Ring) is a very small (22.5 cm x 16.6 cm with frame) oil on panel portrait of an unidentified man attributed to the Early Netherlandish painter Jan van Eyck. It contains a number of elements typical of van Eyck's secular portraits, including a slightly oversized head, a dark and flat background, forensic attention to the small details and textures of the man's face, and illusionistic devices. It had long been thought that the ring held in the man's right hand was meant as an indication of his profession as a jeweler or goldsmith and so the painting was long titled on variants of such. The man is shown in three-quarters view with his face dramatically lit by light falling from the left. This device provides both striking contrasts of light and shadow and draws the viewer's attention on to the man's face. He has brown eyes, and while his expression is impassive there are traces of melancholy, especially in the down-turn of his mouth. He is obviously a member of the nobility, being very well dressed in a fur lined brown jacket over a black undervest. His headdress, a chaperon, contains two wings which hang down over the man's shoulders and extend to his chest. This type of headdress was to go out of fashion by the mid 1430s, conveniently and definitively dating the painting as having been completed before then.	The image features a man wearing a blue turban and a brown robe. He is looking at the camera with a serious expression. The man is holding a small object, possibly a coin or a piece of jewelry, in his hand. The scene appears to be a painting or a drawing, capturing the man's unique attire and the intriguing item he is holding.	0.12025316455696203	0.4222222222222222	0.1871921147758985	0.02092050209205021	0.08333333333333333	0.03344481284549421	0.08227848101265822	0.28888888888888886	0.1280788142832877	0.8023030161857605	0.7169791460037231	0.7572451829910278	0.0	0.11262343870008053
591	The sitter wears a large grey fur lined hat, and grey clothes, fur lined at the neck. holds a small bunch of carnations, symbols of marriage. The man is older, probably in his early 50s, and has a coarse, rough look, which the artist does not shy from depicting.	The image features a man wearing a fur hat and a red robe, with a chain around his neck. He is looking at the camera, possibly posing for a portrait. The man appears to be a prominent figure, possibly a religious leader or a historical figure. The portrait is painted in a darker tone, giving it a more dramatic and intense feel.	0.275	0.2391304347826087	0.2558139485127096	0.0425531914893617	0.03278688524590164	0.0370370321210569	0.25	0.21739130434782608	0.2325581345592213	0.811180591583252	0.7972173690795898	0.8041383624076843	0.0	0.27093618546135956
604	He is in a formal pose, holding a wooden stick in his right hand, and a gold ring on his little finger. The man is dressed in ceremonial robes, with the collar of the Order of the Golden Fleece around his neck. His coat contains dark embroidered motifs in gold, shaped like oak leaves or ferns. The coat contains large strands of red fur lining at the neck and each wrist. His large black felt hat is similar to that worn by Giovanni Arnolfini in van Eyck's Arnolfini Portrait of 1434.	The image is a painting of a man wearing a hat and a long coat. He is holding a stick in his hand and appears to be looking at the viewer. The man is the main focus of the painting, and his attire suggests that he might be a knight or a nobleman. The painting captures the man's presence and the viewer's attention.	0.26865671641791045	0.43902439024390244	0.3333333286231139	0.10227272727272728	0.14516129032258066	0.11999999515022244	0.22388059701492538	0.36585365853658536	0.27777777306755835	0.7950775623321533	0.7397477626800537	0.7664152979850769	0.0	0.18386108273748725
607	The cardinal is portrayed from three-quarters, as was usual in Flemish painting since as early as the 1430s, on a dark background which enhances the figure, which is instead subject to  a bright light source. Comparison with the preparatory drawing shows that van Eyck changed several realistic details, such as the depth of the shoulders, the lower curve of the nose, the depth of the mouth and mainly the size of the ear, perhaps to strengthen the impression of seniority and, consequently, of authority of the cardinal.	The image features a man wearing a red robe, with a blue background. He is looking directly at the camera, giving the impression of a portrait. The man appears to be an older gentleman, possibly a religious figure or a historical figure. The red robe and blue background create a striking contrast, drawing attention to the man's attire and the overall composition of the image.	0.18333333333333332	0.25	0.21153845665680482	0.0379746835443038	0.047619047619047616	0.042253516190240606	0.18333333333333332	0.25	0.21153845665680482	0.784479022026062	0.7438201904296875	0.7636088132858276	0.0	0.18623895862389586
620	Arnolfini wears a dark green gown, with dark brown fur lining. He wears a red chaperon with cornette tied on top of the head, with the patte hanging behind. The bourrelet is twisted. He has small, slightly oriental eyes, a large nose and an inscrutable stare. The meaning and significance of the scroll held in his left hand is unknown. Arnolfini's folded arms would have rested on the original, but now lost, frame. The couple are shown in an upstairs room with a chest and a bed in it during early summer as indicated by the fruit on the cherry tree outside the window. The room probably functioned as a reception room, as it was the fashion in France and Burgundy where beds in reception rooms were used as seating, except, for example, when a mother with a new baby received visitors. The window has six interior wooden shutters, but only the top opening has glass, with clear bulls-eye pieces set in blue, red and green stained glass. The two figures are very richly dressed; despite the season both their outer garments, his tabard and her dress, are trimmed and fully lined with fur. The furs may be the especially expensive sable for him and ermine or miniver for her. He wears a hat of plaited straw dyed black, as often worn in the summer at the time. His tabard was more purple than it appears now (as the pigments have faded over time) and may be intended to be silk velvet (another very expensive item). Underneath he wears a doublet of patterned material, probably silk damask. Her dress has elaborate dagging (cloth folded and sewn together, then cut and frayed decoratively) on the sleeves, and a long train. Her blue underdress is also trimmed with white fur. Although the woman's plain gold necklace and the rings that both wear are the only jewellery visible, both outfits would have been enormously expensive, and appreciated as such by a contemporary viewer. The interior of the room has other signs of wealth; the brass chandelier is large and elaborate by contemporary standards, and would have been very expensive. It would probably have had a mechanism with pulley and chains above, to lower it for managing the candles (possibly omitted from the painting for lack of room). The convex mirror at the back, in a wooden frame with scenes of The Passion painted behind glass, is shown larger than such mirrors could actually be made at this date – another discreet departure from realism by van Eyck. There is also no sign of a fireplace (including in the mirror), nor anywhere obvious to put one. Even the oranges casually placed to the left are a sign of wealth; they were very expensive in Burgundy, and may have been one of the items dealt in by Arnolfini. Further signs of luxury are the elaborate bed-hangings and the carvings on the chair and bench against the back wall (to the right, partly hidden by the bed), also the small Oriental carpet on the floor by the bed; many owners of such expensive objects placed them on tables, as they still do in the Netherlands. The view in the mirror shows two figures just inside the door that the couple are facing. The second figure, wearing red, is presumably the artist although, unlike Velázquez in Las Meninas, he does not seem to be painting. Scholars have made this assumption based on the appearance of figures wearing red head-dresses in some other van Eyck works (e.g., the Portrait of a Man (Self Portrait?) and the figure in the background of the Madonna with Chancellor Rolin). The dog is an early form of the breed now known as the Brussels griffon.	The image depicts a painting of a man and a woman, both dressed in medieval clothing. The man is wearing a hat and a long coat, while the woman is holding a baby. They are standing close to each other, with the woman's hand placed on the man's chest.

622	The work is still in its original frame, which is painted over to look like bronze. Like the London self-portrait, the painting is dominated by black and dark brown hues, with red overtones. De Leeuw is presented as a serious young man with a rather intense gaze. He is wearing a black chaperon and black fur lined jacket. He turns to look at the viewer while holding a gold ring band with a red jewel, a symbol of his profession, although some have suggested that it might indicate a recent marriage engagement, or even, given his direct gaze, that the painted is meant for his intended. The letters are painted in black, and are in the Flemish vernacular.	The image is a painting of a man wearing a hat and a robe. He is holding a piece of bread in his hand. The painting is set in a frame, giving it a vintage appearance.	0.16666666666666666	0.5833333333333334	0.25925925580246917	0.034782608695652174	0.11428571428571428	0.0533333297555558	0.16666666666666666	0.5833333333333334	0.25925925580246917	0.8357076644897461	0.7503910660743713	0.7907547950744629	0.0	0.1521132275666936
624	Margaret is shown in three-quarter view, that is her body almost directly facing the viewer but not quite. She is set against a flat black and featureless background, wearing an elegant red woolen gown with grey fur lining (in the medieval period fur often represented female sexuality), probably from squirrel, in the neck and cuffs. Her horned wimple is decorated with fine lace. Her left eye shows evidence of a squint, a feature unusually evident in northern Europeans of the era. Her head is out of proportion to her body, and her forehead unusually and fashionably high, a device which allows the artist to concentrate on the facial features of his wife. In addition, the geometric pattern formed by her head-dress, arms and the V of her neck-line allows her face to dominate the image.	The image features a woman wearing a red dress and a white hat. She is wearing a green belt and has a green ribbon around her neck. The woman appears to be staring at the viewer, possibly posing for a portrait. The scene is set against a dark background, which adds a dramatic touch to the image.	0.16494845360824742	0.4	0.23357663820128943	0.03731343283582089	0.09259259259259259	0.05319148526708949	0.15463917525773196	0.375	0.21897809805530402	0.8390482664108276	0.7699554562568665	0.80301833152771	0.017664572239006422	0.15112023845177486
636	Each show a giant, bearded man, wading through water with a large stick, carrying the infant Christ on his shoulders. The pair are set in a highly detailed, richly coloured and atmospheric landscape. There are jagged rocks on either side, set against an early evening sky, with star formations.	The image depicts a man in a pink robe carrying a baby in a pink robe. The man is holding a staff, and the baby is being held above his head. The scene takes place near a body of water, with a boat visible in the background. Another person can be seen in the scene, standing near the water. The overall atmosphere of the image is serene and peaceful.	0.20930232558139536	0.20930232558139536	0.20930232058139547	0.041666666666666664	0.03125	0.03571428081632721	0.18604651162790697	0.18604651162790697	0.1860465066279071	0.8041048049926758	0.7928767800331116	0.7984513640403748	0.0	0.17529215358931552
638	The fresco was formed by two parts: the right one, with St. George leaving the Princess of Trebizond (Trabzon), which is in good conditions; and the left one, with the dragon in the sea, which is nearly lost. The princess has an elaborated hairdo, with bends holding a large mass of hair; the latter began very highly on the brow, according to a style which was popular in the early 15th century, obtained by cutting the hair on the brow and the temples with a lit candle. The princess' dress is a sumptuous one in cloth and fur. The upper part features a high cliff with an idealized depiction of Trabzon with rich architectures of towers, spires of religious buildings and, on the far right, a castle.	The image depicts a medieval scene with a group of people riding horses and a man on a horse with a dog. The people are dressed in medieval clothing, and the scene appears to be a painting or a fresco. The horses are scattered throughout the scene, with some closer to the foreground and others further in the background. The man on the horse with the dog is positioned towards the right side of the image. The overall atmosphere of the scene is one of historical significance and intrigue.	0.15476190476190477	0.2708333333333333	0.1969696923415979	0.05	0.07228915662650602	0.05911329565871573	0.13095238095238096	0.22916666666666666	0.16666666203856764	0.7847577929496765	0.740531861782074	0.7620036602020264	0.0	0.19359646763492921
661	The painting depicts St. Anthony being clubbed by three devils who have surrounded him.	The image depicts a scene of a man lying on the ground, possibly dead, while a group of monsters or demons surround him. There are at least four monsters in the scene, with one on the left side, another on the right side, and two more in the middle. The monsters appear to be engaged in a battle or a confrontation with the man. The overall atmosphere of the image is intense and dramatic.	0.21428571428571427	0.0625	0.09677419005202925	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.21428571428571427	0.0625	0.09677419005202925	0.7282092571258545	0.7996947765350342	0.7622796893119812	0.0	0.2199962553828871
662	It is a small panel, divided into two different scenes: in the upper part is St. Jerome with the wooden cross, the stone to strike his breast and the lectern lying on the rock. In the lower part, with a chronological step, is the episode of the saint with the lion having a thorn in the paw. The unfriendly landscape is a metaphor of the hermit style of life.	The image depicts a scene where a man and a child are sitting on rocks, with a skull nearby. The man is holding a stick, and the child is holding a skull. There is a dog in the scene as well, positioned between the man and the child. The setting appears to be a cave, with a bench visible in the background.	0.1875	0.2571428571428571	0.2168674650021775	0.0625	0.07547169811320754	0.06837606342026481	0.1875	0.2571428571428571	0.2168674650021775	0.801365852355957	0.7693370580673218	0.7850249409675598	0.0	0.22874984641218873
665	The tabernacle is composed of a rectangular marble frame, with a triangular top with a sculpted almond depicting the "Blessing Christ and Cherubims". In the center, within an arched opening, are Fra Angelico's panel of the Maestà with twelve musician angels. At the front are two shutter panels with further paintings of saints. The panels are completed by a  predella, placed below, with three scenes of St. Peter Dictating the Gospel to St. Mark, Adoration of the Magi and Martyrdom of St. Mark. The central panel, although damaged, has a style similar to Angelico's early works, with a marble step over which is the throne. Behind two draperies (perhaps a hint to the guild's textile activities) is a ceiling painted in blue with stars and the Holy Spirit dove, which is similar to Masolino's Annunciation in Washington, DC.	The image features a painting of a woman, possibly Mary, holding a baby. She is surrounded by a group of people, including a man and a child, who are all looking at her. The painting is set in a beautifully decorated room, with a chair and a couch visible in the background. The scene appears to be a religious or spiritual gathering, with the woman holding the baby as the center of attention.	0.12087912087912088	0.22	0.15602836421709185	0.022900763358778626	0.04225352112676056	0.02970296573816363	0.10989010989010989	0.2	0.1418439670539713	0.7758405804634094	0.7282401323318481	0.7512871623039246	0.0	0.16108588034287885
667	Its central panel shows the Madonna as the Madonna of humility. Its left panel shows John the Baptist, whilst its right panel shows Saint George or Saint Ansanus.	The image features a painting of a woman holding a baby, surrounded by several other people. The woman is positioned in the center of the painting, and the baby is held close to her. The other people in the painting are scattered around the woman and the baby, with some standing closer to the foreground and others further in the background. The painting is displayed in a frame, which adds to the overall presentation of the artwork.	0.10526315789473684	0.045454545454545456	0.06349205927941574	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.10526315789473684	0.045454545454545456	0.06349205927941574	0.7228591442108154	0.7392149567604065	0.7309456467628479	0.0	0.12362637362637365
684	It shows the painting's donor, Joris van der Paele, within an apparition of saints. The Virgin Mary is enthroned at the centre of the semicircular space, which most likely represents a church interior, with the Christ Child on her lap. St. Donatian stands to her right, Saint George — the donor's name saint — to her left. He is dressed in the finery of a medieval canon, including white surplice, as he piously reads from a book of hours. He is presented to Mary by Saint George, his name saint, who holds aloft his metal helmet in respect. Saint Donatian, dressed in brightly coloured vestments, stands to the left. The Virgin's throne is decorated with carved representations of Adam and Eve, prefigurations of the Crucifixion and Resurrection of Jesus, and scenes from the Old Testament. The panel has an overall sculptural look; the throne, windows, arches and hanging canvases borrow from the conventions of Romanesque architecture. The precision of the detail achieved is especially noticeable in the rendering of threads of St. Donatian's blue and golden embroidered cope and mitre, in the weave of the oriental carpet, and in the stubble and veins on van der Paele's aging face.	The image depicts a medieval scene with a woman sitting on a chair, holding a baby. She is surrounded by several other people, including a man who is holding a baby in his arms. The people in the scene are dressed in medieval attire, with some of them wearing swords. The setting appears to be a church, as indicated by the presence of a pew. The overall atmosphere of the scene is one of historical significance and importance.	0.13953488372093023	0.34615384615384615	0.19889502352919636	0.026881720430107527	0.06756756756756757	0.038461534389349544	0.12403100775193798	0.3076923076923077	0.17679557601538426	0.804336428642273	0.7155356407165527	0.7573418617248535	0.0	0.11542012927054475
732	The lower one shows the Magi and their procession homaging the Child and the Virgin; the upper one has several scenes with groups of shepherds, the arrival of the Magi led by the comet star and the final part of the procession with dogs and camels. The foreground depicts the Virgin who sits under the hut with the ox and the donkey, holding the Child on her knees. The three Magi have different stances: the eldest has removed is crown and is kneeling; he is donating an elaborated golden object to the Child, who stretches his hands to accept it and bless him. The mature Magus is portrayed while putting down his crown and a gilt casket in the left hand; the youngest is observing the scene from behind. The two characters with halos, in the first row behind the Child, are St. Joseph and St. Anne. The servants of the Magi include numerous races, from the Mongols to the Moors.	The image depicts a group of people gathered around a baby, with some of them kneeling down. The people are dressed in various attire, including a man wearing a crown. The scene appears to be a religious gathering, with the baby being the center of attention.  In the background, there are several animals, including horses and a cow. The horses are positioned in the upper part of the image, while the cow is located in the lower left corner. The presence of these animals adds to the overall atmosphere of the scene.	0.20408163265306123	0.3389830508474576	0.2547770653722261	0.053691275167785234	0.0898876404494382	0.06722688607407701	0.15306122448979592	0.2542372881355932	0.1910827978563026	0.8119388222694397	0.7725009918212891	0.7917291522026062	0.0	0.15910430170889805
734	The princess is shown in profile against a background of numerous butterflies and columbine flowers. The butterfly (it seems a Vanessa atalanta) near the princess' brow is a symbol of the soul.	The image features a woman wearing a red dress and a white headband. She is surrounded by a beautiful garden of flowers, with a variety of flowers in different sizes and colors. The woman appears to be the main focus of the scene, as she stands in the center of the garden.	0.3076923076923077	0.21621621621621623	0.2539682491206854	0.03225806451612903	0.02	0.02469135329980276	0.3076923076923077	0.21621621621621623	0.2539682491206854	0.790326714515686	0.7737293839454651	0.7819399833679199	0.0	0.24123597756410256
740	They show the Virgin Mary and Archangel Gabriel in an Annunciation scene painted in grisaille, which because of their near-monochrome colouring give the impression that the figures are sculpted. The three inner panels are set in an ecclesiastical interior. In the central inner panel Mary is seated and holds the Christ Child on her lap. On the left hand wing Archangel Michael presents a kneeling donor, while on the right St. Catherine of Alexandria stands reading a prayer book. The interior panels are outlined with two layers of painted bronze frames, inscribed with mostly Latin lettering.	The image is a painting of a medieval scene, featuring a woman sitting on a chair with a baby in her lap. The woman is wearing a red dress, and the baby is being held by her. There are several other people in the scene, including a man standing to the left of the woman and a few others scattered throughout the painting. The painting captures the essence of a medieval court, with the woman possibly being a queen or a noblewoman.	0.18055555555555555	0.2765957446808511	0.21848739017865984	0.021505376344086023	0.02564102564102564	0.023391807903971502	0.18055555555555555	0.2765957446808511	0.21848739017865984	0.8002713918685913	0.7536133527755737	0.7762418985366821	0.0	0.19493177387914232
750	Also differently from previous works, Lippi painted the Virgin as standing, and made her the central point of the composition. The angel on the left pulling up his garment is inspired by Nanni di Banco's group of the "Quattro Coronati", a sculpture in a niche of Orsanmichele. Another element of innovation (introduced at the same time by Fra Angelico) was the lack of a gilded background, replaced by an architectural space with a window opening to hilly landscape, inspired to Flemish contemporary works. The shell-shaped niche in the background, a typical element of 15th century Florentine painting, and of Lippi in particular, is inspired by a niche in the Tribunale of the Mercanzie in Orsanmichele, designed by Donatello. The kneeling saints are St. Augustine on the right and San Frediano on the left. On the left is an alleged portrait of Filippo Lippi, identified as the young monk behind the balustrade.	The image depicts a painting of a woman holding a baby, surrounded by a group of people. The woman is wearing a blue dress, and the baby is being held close to her. The people in the painting are of various sizes and are positioned around the woman and the baby. Some are standing closer to the woman, while others are further away. The painting captures a moment of togetherness and love between the woman and the baby.	0.125	0.2727272727272727	0.17142856711836746	0.028985507246376812	0.056338028169014086	0.03827750747556199	0.10416666666666667	0.22727272727272727	0.1428571385469389	0.7591540217399597	0.6868218183517456	0.7211788296699524	0.0	0.14075887392900854
756	In addition to the main panel depicting the enthroned Virgin and Child surrounded by Angels and Saints, there were 9 predella panels accompanying it, narrating the legend of the patron saints, Saints Cosmas and Damian. The San Marco Altarpiece depicts a portrait of the Virgin and Child seated on a throne surrounded by saints and angels. The formal elements are innovative for a contemporary Virgin and Child altarpiece as the positioning of the characters creates a deeply receding and logical space in front of the landscape background. The pomegranate embroidered curtain behind the Virgin and Child establishes a distinct horizontal line separating the events depicted in the painting from the landscape behind it. The altarpiece is situated on the then newly invented single rectangular panel, which helps turn a typical easel painting into the principal image of the altarpiece. By dressing both kneeling saints as well as several of the angels in red, Angelico creates a vertical link and further geometric stability. On the right, Saint Damian kneels on an inward angle towards the center praising the Virgin and Child, which draws the viewer's eyes towards the painting's vanishing point at the Virgin's chin. The Virgin and Child are featured precisely at the vertical and horizontal axes' intersecting points and are placed above Angelico's Trompe l'oeil depiction of the crucifixion. Though they are sitting on a pedestal, the Virgin and Child do not seem much larger than the rest of the characters, showing a lack of a scale setting the main subjects apart from other mortals.	The image depicts a painting of a religious scene, featuring a woman sitting on a bench with a baby in her arms. She is surrounded by a group of people, including a man kneeling in front of her. The painting is set in a room with a dining table and chairs, and there are several books scattered around the area. The scene appears to be a gathering of people, possibly for a religious ceremony or a special event.	0.1346153846153846	0.39622641509433965	0.20095693401341552	0.03524229074889868	0.10810810810810811	0.05315614247127542	0.10256410256410256	0.3018867924528302	0.1531100440612624	0.7859500646591187	0.7177403569221497	0.7502981424331665	0.0	0.10385360211417162
766	The right wing depicts a seated, pious Saint Barbara, who is shown engrossed in her reading of a bound and gilded holy book, seated in front of a warm open fire which lights the room with a golden glow. The left wing has a donor portrait of Heinrich von Werl, who kneels in prayer in the company of John the Baptist facing the missing devotional center-panel scene, which is lost and unrecorded.	The image is a painting of a medieval scene, featuring a man and a woman. The man is kneeling down, while the woman is sitting on a chair. They are surrounded by various objects, including a dog, a cat, a bird, and a book. The room also contains a fireplace, a clock, and a vase. The painting captures the atmosphere of a historical period, with the man and woman dressed in medieval attire.	0.18867924528301888	0.22727272727272727	0.20618556205335334	0.014285714285714285	0.014705882352941176	0.014492748624240328	0.1509433962264151	0.18181818181818182	0.16494844865129146	0.779901385307312	0.740174412727356	0.7595188021659851	0.0	0.19423558897243107
771	The Madonna is depicted dressed in blue, her figure framed by a richly embroidered cloth of honor supported by two angels. The Christ Child holds prayer beads in his left hand, suggesting, along with the rose bush behind the figures, the rosary.	The image depicts a painting of a woman, possibly Mary, holding a baby. The woman is dressed in a blue gown and is surrounded by a red and gold background. The baby is being held close to her, and the scene appears to be a religious or spiritual representation. The painting is set in a frame, which adds to the artistic presentation.	0.21621621621621623	0.19047619047619047	0.2025316405896492	0.04878048780487805	0.03333333333333333	0.03960395557298363	0.21621621621621623	0.19047619047619047	0.2025316405896492	0.8086959719657898	0.8054773807525635	0.8070834279060364	0.0	0.2676965748118636
784	The painting is structured into three levels. The top terrace shows a Deësis of God the Son, the Virgin Mary and St. John the Evangelist. The middle section shows four groups of angels, while the lower level has two groups of holy men; with Christians led by a Pope and princes to the right, and Jews led by blindfolded high priests to the left. These two groups represent true believers and non true believers in Christ as the messiah respectively. The Fountain of Life is a symbol referring to baptism and or eucharist. The water that flows from the top to the lower terrace, is intended as a symbol of "the Grace that illuminates the Triumphant Church and blinds the Synagogue". The painting is organised into three horizontal levels or planes, each showing a terrace on which the figures are positioned.	The image depicts a large painting of a church scene, featuring a group of people gathered around a fountain. The painting is set in a medieval-style church, with a castle-like structure in the background. The people in the painting are dressed in various attire, some wearing ties, and they are engaged in conversations or observing the fountain. The painting captures the essence of a lively and bustling church community.	0.12643678160919541	0.2558139534883721	0.16923076480355043	0.015503875968992248	0.03125	0.020725384168166536	0.11494252873563218	0.23255813953488372	0.15384614941893504	0.7974257469177246	0.7416581511497498	0.7685315608978271	0.0	0.1475008463623254
794	Mary stands in majesty, holding the child Christ and standing on an oriental carpet. Around her are Saint Barbara, standing before the tower in which she was prisoned, Saint Elizabeth of Hungary dressed in a nun's habit, and the donor Jan Vos (d. 1462), depicted as a Carthusian monk kneeling in prayer. A statue of the deity Mars can be seen through the window of Barbara's tower.	The image depicts a religious scene with a group of people, including a man and a woman, kneeling in front of a painting of Mary and the baby Jesus. The woman is holding a baby, and the man is also present in the scene. The painting is located in the center of the image, and the people are gathered around it, showing their devotion and respect. The scene appears to be a church setting, with the people participating in a prayer or a religious ceremony.	0.20754716981132076	0.22448979591836735	0.2156862695174934	0.06060606060606061	0.05063291139240506	0.05517240883329415	0.16981132075471697	0.1836734693877551	0.17647058324298362	0.785171627998352	0.7480127811431885	0.7661418914794922	0.0	0.21091811414392062
805	The scene is set within a domed apse-like building, as an altarpiece takes center stage it is presumably a church. The Virgin stands to the left, to her right is Anna the Prophetess and behind her, only partially visible is St. Joseph, who holds the sacrificial doves. Simeon is dressed in green and appears quite regal, although he appears to be crying, perhalps because he knows the tragedy that awaits Christ in later life. He holds the Christ child, the stained glass behind them shows a representation of Moses holding the Tablets of Stone.	The image depicts a group of people, including a man and a woman, gathered around a dining table. The man is holding a baby, and the woman is holding a book. The scene appears to be a religious gathering, with the people dressed in religious attire. The dining table is adorned with a book, a cup, and a bowl, suggesting that the gathering might involve a meal or a shared activity.	0.19718309859154928	0.3111111111111111	0.24137930559601672	0.043478260869565216	0.06060606060606061	0.0506329065278005	0.18309859154929578	0.28888888888888886	0.22413792628567195	0.7803917527198792	0.7460570335388184	0.7628382444381714	0.0	0.21270569957410318
807	The composition pivots around the Virgin, who occupies the centre of the scene. In the background, on the right, two small figures of women are riding a stair. The two donor portraits show the unknown donors kneeling behind a cordonata.	The image depicts a beautiful woman dressed in a blue gown, standing on a platform and holding a book. She appears to be a religious figure, possibly a nun, as she is surrounded by other people. One person is kneeling in front of her, while another person is standing nearby. The scene also includes a bird, possibly a dove, which adds to the religious atmosphere. The setting seems to be a church or a similar religious institution.	0.22580645161290322	0.12727272727272726	0.1627906930638184	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.1935483870967742	0.10909090909090909	0.13953487911033008	0.7811951637268066	0.8068421483039856	0.793811559677124	0.0	0.1892430278884462
809	The panel is divided in two by a central column. It uses a geometrical perspective to show a complex architecture including several edifices and an open loggia. These include the glass ampulla in the foreground, symbolizing the Holy Spirit.	The image depicts a beautiful scene of angels and a woman in a church. There are three angels, each with a different pose, standing in the foreground. One angel is on the left side, another in the middle, and the third angel is on the right side of the image.   A woman is kneeling in front of the angels, and she is holding a book. The scene is set in a church, with a potted plant located in the background. The overall atmosphere of the image is serene and peaceful, as the woman and the angels interact in this sacred space.	0.17647058823529413	0.10909090909090909	0.1348314559525314	0.02631578947368421	0.011235955056179775	0.01574802730237572	0.17647058823529413	0.10909090909090909	0.1348314559525314	0.7577024102210999	0.7849528193473816	0.7710869312286377	0.0	0.16966067864271456
815	The three panels are each 71 x 43 cm and show, from left to right, a portrait of the Holy Family, a Pietà (the Virgin cradling the dead body of Jesus) and Christ's appearance to Mary—a chronological reading of the birth, death and resurrection of Jesus, with Mary the focus of both wings. It is notable for its use of colour, distinguished by its use of whites, reds and blues, and use of line—notably the line of Christ's body in the central panel—and, typically of van der Weyden, its emotional impact. Typical for triptychs of the period, the altarpiece is rich in religious symbolism; each panel is framed by a rounded arch with Gothic decorations in open tracery below and in the spandrel.	The image depicts a religious scene featuring two men, one of whom is a priest, and a woman. The woman is kneeling in front of the priest, who is blessing her. The scene is set in a church, with a large stained glass window in the background. The stained glass window features a depiction of a sun, which adds a sense of spirituality to the scene.	0.12195121951219512	0.2564102564102564	0.16528925182979318	0.017241379310344827	0.031746031746031744	0.022346364153429346	0.12195121951219512	0.2564102564102564	0.16528925182979318	0.7918108105659485	0.7364801168441772	0.76314377784729	0.0	0.12195121951219512
818	Side panels are painted on both sides, showing Christ on the right and Mary Magdalene on the left (the upper part, on reverse of the Amsterdam panel, does not survive); together they used to form a Noli me tangere scene when the triptych was folded shut. The central panel depicts the Annunciation inside a Gothic church, the angel appearing under a vault. Above him, from a holed rose window, God and two angels are coming in, while the Madonna is kneeling at the right, with two perspectically painted naves in the background. The two panels do not form a continuous scene, however; Mary Magdalene is placed among lush green hills, while Christ is surrounded by a more desolate, desert-like landscape. The wide clothes show the inspiration by the Burgundian school. The light is of clearly Flemish derivation (Robert Campin), such as (although with some Provençal elements) the minute details, including the winged devil and the bat in the left arch.	The image depicts a medieval scene with two people dressed in religious garb. One person is kneeling down, while the other is standing. They are both holding books, possibly religious texts or prayer books. The scene is set in a large, ornate building with a clock on the wall. The architecture and the presence of the clock suggest that this could be a church or a similar religious institution.	0.14035087719298245	0.3137254901960784	0.19393938966831967	0.03896103896103896	0.08823529411764706	0.05405404980439933	0.13157894736842105	0.29411764705882354	0.1818181775471075	0.7902247905731201	0.7396705746650696	0.7641124725341797	0.0	0.13333049633734034
822	It depicts the Virgin humbly accepting her role as mother of Jesus, with a hand on her breast, while the dove, symbol of the Holy Spirit, is given to her. The angel is kneeling next to her, also with a hand on his breast a greeting sign. The scene is framed into a portico opening to a close garden.	The image depicts a beautiful scene of an angel kneeling down to a woman, who is also kneeling. The woman is holding a book, possibly a Bible, while the angel is holding a cross. The setting appears to be a church, with a potted plant nearby. The scene is filled with a sense of reverence and spiritual connection.	0.30952380952380953	0.34210526315789475	0.3249999950125001	0.10909090909090909	0.1111111111111111	0.11009173811968712	0.2857142857142857	0.3157894736842105	0.2999999950125001	0.8348984122276306	0.8150671124458313	0.824863612651825	0.0	0.33466607109491775
845	Originally part of a now dismantled altarpiece known as Peter's Altar Table, the panel depicts the miraculous catch of 153 fish as reported in the Gospel of John and shows a scene of the disciples, who had been fishing at the edge of a lake, recognising the stranger who had called out to them from the shore as the resurrected Jesus. Peter is shown wading toward Jesus to greet him. The buildings and rocks to the right are reflected, as are the coloured clothes of the men hauling a net in the small boat. In the foreground the water is so transparent the bed of the lake can be seen, while at the far end of the lake the tone of the water surface dissolves into a silvery expanse. Only the figure of Christ standing at the edge of the shore does not cast a reflection, the implication being that the laws of nature do not apply to the divine.	The image depicts a painting of Jesus Christ standing on a boat in the middle of a lake. He is surrounded by several people, including a group of men and women, who appear to be enjoying the boat ride. The boat is filled with people, and some of them are holding umbrellas, possibly to shield themselves from the sun or rain. The scene captures a moment of togetherness and spiritual connection among the people on the boat.	0.21212121212121213	0.3888888888888889	0.27450979935409464	0.027972027972027972	0.05333333333333334	0.036697243192913606	0.18181818181818182	0.3333333333333333	0.23529411307958487	0.8104846477508545	0.7670831680297852	0.7881868481636047	0.0	0.14983237966468985
848	The panels show – from left to right – the birth of Saint John, the baptism of Christ by John in Jordan, and the beheading of John, with the rather attractive Salome receiving the disembodied head on a plate. Each panel is set within painted archivolts, which contain painted reliefs depicting statuettes of the apostles, and scenes from the lives of both Christ and John, with the overall theme of salvation. The three panels describe the major events in John's life: his birth, baptism of Christ, and his decapitation at the hands of Salome.	The image depicts a religious scene with several people, including a man and a woman, kneeling down and praying. The man is touching the woman's head, possibly blessing her. The scene is set in a church, with a large stained glass window in the background. The people in the scene are dressed in medieval-style clothing, further emphasizing the religious context.	0.12903225806451613	0.2	0.1568627403306422	0.011111111111111112	0.017241379310344827	0.013513508747262454	0.12903225806451613	0.2	0.1568627403306422	0.7846565246582031	0.7414140701293945	0.7624226808547974	0.0	0.1723566741959772
878	The scene depicts, above a gilt background, a slender St. Francis of Assisi who, in the center, consigns the Franciscan Rule to his brothers, who are kneeling around him. The men at the left, with Fra Leone receiving the book, and the women at the right, including St. Claire. At the top are two symmetrical flying birds, which hold two cartouches.	The image depicts a religious scene with a man in a brown robe standing in the center, surrounded by a group of people. The man in the brown robe appears to be a priest, and he is holding a book. The people surrounding him are likely members of the congregation, and they are all looking up at the priest. The scene is set in a church, with the priest standing on a step, and the people are gathered around him, showing their respect and devotion.	0.2857142857142857	0.27450980392156865	0.27999999500200007	0.0847457627118644	0.06329113924050633	0.07246376322096232	0.2653061224489796	0.2549019607843137	0.25999999500200005	0.7888608574867249	0.7712382078170776	0.779949963092804	0.0	0.28757056013894927
879	The painting depicts Jesus and the Apostles during the Last Supper, with Judas, unlike all the other apostles, sitting separately on the near side of the table, as is common in depictions of the Last Supper in Christian art. Except for Judas, Christ and his apostles, including the recumbent St John, all have a translucent disc of a halo above their heads. The hand positions of the final pair of apostles on either end of the fresco mirror each other with accomplished realism. The colors of the apostles' robes and their postures contribute to the balance of the piece. Furthermore, the color highlights in the hair of the figures, flowing robes, and perspective in the halos foreshadow advancements to come. The right hand of St Peter appears to be replaced by a left hand.	The image depicts a painting of a group of people gathered around a long dining table. There are at least 13 people in the scene, with some sitting and others standing. The table is filled with various items, including multiple wine glasses, cups, and bowls. The people are engaged in conversation and enjoying their time together. The painting captures the essence of a social gathering, with everyone sharing a meal and spending quality time with one another.	0.1511627906976744	0.24074074074074073	0.18571428097551032	0.024	0.04	0.029999995312500735	0.1511627906976744	0.24074074074074073	0.18571428097551032	0.7832223176956177	0.7340468168258667	0.7578376531600952	0.0	0.13485477178423236
882	It is divided into three sections. The central one, on his podium with steps and framed by a shell-shaped niche, is the scene of the coronation of Mary: she is kneeling at the feet of Christ, who puts the crown on his head. At the sides are two symmetrical compositions of three musician angels and two standing saints in the foreground. The latter, who are connected to the monastic orders, are presenting the two donors, Gregorio Marsuppini and his son Carlo, both kneeling.	The image depicts a painting of Jesus being crowned with a crown of thorns. The painting features a large group of people surrounding Jesus, with some of them kneeling down to worship him. The scene captures the moment when Jesus is being adored by the people, creating a sense of awe and reverence. The painting is set in a beautifully decorated room, with a bench visible in the background.	0.22413793103448276	0.2765957446808511	0.247619042673923	0.012345679012345678	0.015151515151515152	0.013605437228934187	0.1896551724137931	0.23404255319148937	0.20952380457868494	0.7975412011146545	0.7632911205291748	0.780040442943573	0.0	0.16111707841031148
885	The setting is however reminiscent of the frames, with three ogival arches, the columns and the shell-shaped niches. The polychrome floor, and the architecture, including the base of the Madonna's throne, is depicted with the  use of geometrical perspective, an innovation introduced in Italian early Renaissance art.	The image depicts a painting of a group of people, including a woman sitting on a bench and a baby in her arms. The woman is wearing a blue dress, and the baby is positioned close to her. There are several other people in the scene, some standing and others sitting, all gathered around the woman and the baby. The painting captures a moment of togetherness and connection among the individuals.	0.2	0.15555555555555556	0.17499999507812514	0.022727272727272728	0.014705882352941176	0.017857138086735967	0.17142857142857143	0.13333333333333333	0.14999999507812514	0.7324762344360352	0.7383895516395569	0.7354210019111633	0.0	0.22298456260720415
890	It depicts the seven sacraments of the Roman Catholic Church. On the left panel are baptism, confirmation and confession and on the right hand panel the ordination of a priest, marriage and the last rites. The central panel (possibly the only autograph part of the work) is dominated by a crucifixion in the foreground, with the sacrament of the Eucharist in the background. Angels hover over each sacrament with scrolls, with clothes colour-matched to the sacraments, from white for baptism to black for the last rites. The side panels also depict the altarpiece's commissioners, along with some portrait heads only added shortly before the work was completed. Two coats of arms (probably that of the commissioners) (left: "sable" chevron on "or" field; right: "argent" tower on "sable" field) are painted in the spandrels of the painting's inner frame.	The image depicts a large group of people gathered in a church, with many of them kneeling down in front of a cross. The scene is filled with various individuals, some of whom are wearing ties, indicating a formal or religious setting. The people are spread throughout the scene, with some standing closer to the cross and others further away. The overall atmosphere of the image suggests a sense of reverence and devotion to the religious symbol.	0.12903225806451613	0.23529411764705882	0.166666662092014	0.03125	0.05333333333333334	0.03940886233589805	0.12903225806451613	0.23529411764705882	0.166666662092014	0.7809684872627258	0.7250353097915649	0.7519631385803223	0.0	0.14542987591890316
900	The fresco is composed as a large miniature, where in a luxurious garden surrounded by a hedge, Death enters riding a skeletal horse, firing arrows from a bow. Death aims at characters belonging to all social levels, killing them. The horse occupies the centre of the scene, with its ribs visible and an emaciated head showing teeth and the tongue. Death has just released an arrow, which has hit a young man in the lower right corner; Death also wears scythe at the side of the saddle, its typical attribute. On the lower part are corpses of the people previously killed: emperors, popes, bishops, friars (both Franciscans and Dominicans), poets, knights and maidens. Each character is portrayed differently: some still have a grimace of pain on the face, while others are serene; some have their limbs dismembered on the ground, and others are kneeling after having been just struck by an arrow. On the left is a group of poor people, invoking Death to stop their suffering, but being ignored. Among them, the figure looking towards the observer has been proposed as a possible self-portrait of the artist. On the right is a group of the nobles, shown as having no interest in the events, most of them continuing their activities. They include several musicians, richly dressed noblewomen  and knights with fur clothes, as symbols of life and youth. A man has a hawk on his arm, and another is leading two hounds.	The image is a painting featuring a skeleton riding a horse, surrounded by a crowd of people. The skeleton is positioned in the center of the scene, while the horse is located towards the left side. The people in the painting are scattered throughout the scene, with some standing closer to the skeleton and others further away. The painting captures a unique and intriguing scene, combining elements of life and death.	0.1518987341772152	0.5454545454545454	0.2376237589687286	0.05701754385964912	0.19117647058823528	0.08783783429875834	0.12025316455696203	0.4318181818181818	0.1881188084736791	0.8466463088989258	0.754694402217865	0.7980303168296814	0.0	0.11805171055812463
902	The majority, if not all, of the figures (described in the text as "Chevaliers, conseillers, et chambellans", are portraits of historical figures. The decorative border of the presentation miniature includes the arms of the various territories making up Philip's dukedom, which he had considerably expanded, interspersed with his personal emblem of sparks being struck from a flint. The translation had been commissioned by Philip, and the manuscript that both contains the miniature and shows it being presented was at that point the only one existing.	The image is a page from an old book, depicting a scene of people gathered around a man who is kneeling down. The people are standing in various positions, with some closer to the man and others further away. The man kneeling is holding a book, which is open and placed in front of him. The scene appears to be a historical or religious event, as the people seem to be engaged in a shared activity or discussion.	0.19696969696969696	0.2549019607843137	0.2222222173044051	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.15151515151515152	0.19607843137254902	0.17094016602235385	0.7479443550109863	0.7206151485443115	0.7340254187583923	0.0	0.16734279918864098
914	It portrays Christ being baptised by John, his head surmounted by a dove representing the Holy Spirit. Christ, John's hand, the bird and the bowl form an axis which divides the painting in two symmetrical parts. A second division is created by the tree on the left, which instead divides it according to the golden ratio. Behind John, a man in white briefs, his feet already in the water, is struggling to get out of his undershirt. The three angels on the left wear different clothes and, in a break from traditional iconography, are not supporting Christ's garments, but are holding each other's hands, in a sort of way. Such symbolism is also suggested by the presence, behind the neophyte on the right, of figures dressed in an oriental fashion. Piero della Francesca was renowned in his times as an authority on perspective and geometry: his attention to the theme is shown by John's arm and leg, which form two angles of the same size.	The image depicts a scene from the Bible, where Jesus is being baptized by John the Baptist. The painting features several people, including Jesus, John, and other individuals, all gathered around a tree. The tree serves as a focal point in the scene, with the people standing around it.  In the background, there is a bird flying, adding a sense of life and movement to the painting. The overall atmosphere of the painting is one of spirituality and reverence, capturing the moment when Jesus began his ministry.	0.16071428571428573	0.2903225806451613	0.2068965471370063	0.025157232704402517	0.047058823529411764	0.03278688070579209	0.15178571428571427	0.27419354838709675	0.19540229426344308	0.8092154264450073	0.7487888932228088	0.7778303027153015	0.0	0.16758241758241757
928	A Goldsmith in His Shop, Possibly Saint Eligius is a 1449 painting by Petrus Christus, now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The main figure in the painting was long thought to be Saint Eligius, the patron saint of goldsmiths, due to the presence of a halo.	The image depicts a painting of a man in a red outfit, possibly a cardinal, surrounded by two other people. The man in the red outfit is holding a woman's hand, while the other two individuals are standing nearby. The painting features a dining table in the background, with various items placed on it, such as a wine glass, a cup, and a bowl. Additionally, there are two clocks in the scene, one on the left side and the other on the right side of the painting.	0.2222222222222222	0.1509433962264151	0.179775276081303	0.06666666666666667	0.037037037037037035	0.04761904302721133	0.19444444444444445	0.1320754716981132	0.15730336596894345	0.7490742206573486	0.7306374311447144	0.7397409677505493	0.0	0.21626297577854675
930	In the center is Saint John the Baptist, patron saint of Florence, flanked by the Saints Cosmas and Damian (protectors of the Medici, and in particular of Cosimo de' Medici, Piero's father). On the right, in the foreground, is Saint Peter of Verona, protector of Piero di Cosimo de' Medici, and next to him is Saint John the Evangelist, protector of his brother Giovanni. On the left, in the foreground, are Saint Francis of Assisi, the patron of Pierfrancesco the Elder (Piero's cousin), and Saint Lawrence, patron of his uncle, Lorenzo the Elder.

932	A Man Reading (Saintt Ivo?) is the name given to a panel painting in the collection of the National Gallery, United Kingdom.	The image features a man dressed in a robe, sitting in a room and reading a book. He appears to be focused on the content of the book, which is placed in his hands. The room has a window, allowing natural light to enter the space.

The image depicts a painting of Jesus and two other people, possibly Mary and John the Baptist. The painting is set in a landscape with a river and a mountain in the background. The three figures are standing close to each other, with Jesus in the center, and the other two figures on either side of him. The painting captures the essence of the religious scene, with the figures dressed in traditional garments.	0.4166666666666667	0.22727272727272727	0.29411764249134953	0.10714285714285714	0.04285714285714286	0.06122448571428599	0.2916666666666667	0.1590909090909091	0.2058823483737025	0.7624916434288025	0.8065227270126343	0.7838894128799438	0.0	0.263826996935512
984	The painting shows the crucified Jesus, portrayed with a very pale skin, on a broad landscape background. The deep blue sky is populated by cherubims who are weeping his death. In the lower part are Mary and St. John. The background shows several details, including a lake with a wooden bridge, a quarry, small houses and a series of small working figures.	The image depicts a scene of Jesus being crucified, with a large cross in the center. There are several people in the scene, including a man standing next to the cross, a woman praying, and other individuals scattered throughout the image.  In the background, there are two boats visible, one on the left side and the other on the right side of the image. The overall atmosphere of the scene is solemn and reflective of the crucifixion of Jesus.	0.25	0.24	0.24489795418575602	0.05	0.041666666666666664	0.045454540495868306	0.25	0.24	0.24489795418575602	0.8208954334259033	0.8155409693717957	0.8182094693183899	0.0	0.26541009495554946
998	It shows a scene from the biblical entombment of Christ, and was probably completed between 1440 and 1455 as a wing panel for a large hinged polyptych altarpiece. It shows four female and three male mourners grieving over the body of Christ. They are, from left to right, Nicodemus, Mary Salome, Mary of Clopas, Mary, the mother of Jesus, John the Evangelist, Mary Magdalene and Joseph of Arimathea. The Entombment shows Christ's body, wrapped in a white linen shroud and still wearing a crown of thorns, as it is lowered into a deep stone tomb. He is attended by seven mourners dressed in contemporary clothing. Among the group of mourners standing at Christ's side, the three female figures are shown with downcast eyes while the two men look directly at Christ; these gazes are reversed with the couple kneeling at his feet. The background contains a wide landscape with a winding pathway and a broad river before a more distant vista of trees and hills. The vista in The Entombment is regarded as one of his finest, and is typically  composed of distant brown and green hills against a blue sky. The Virgin wears a white headdress and a dark blue dress with a yellowish mantle, and holds Christ's arm just above his wrist as if afraid to let go of her dead son. She is supported by John the Evangelist, who wears a red robe. Dressed in green robes, Mary Salome stands to the Virgin's left, wiping tears from her face with the fold of her white headdress. Mary of Clopas is behind them, holding a red cloth over her mouth, while the Magdalen is in the foreground at Christ's feet, dressed in a heavily folded cloak. The man in the brown–green tabard at the feet of Christ is probably Joseph of Arimathea, who, according to Gospel, brought Christ's body to Golgotha from Pontius Pilate. Azurite and lead-white line the under-paint, while the landscape contains indigo mixed with lead-tin yellow. The sky and Nicodemus' collar are painted with lighter and less intense azurite, while the Virgin's dress is azurite mixed with ultramarine and smalt, a blue ground-glass pigment. Rusty nail holes can be seen in the lower border and across the top of the picture in an area of sky that was initially covered by frame.	The image depicts a group of people gathered around a man lying on a stone slab. The man appears to be dead, and the people are attending to him, possibly preparing for burial. There are at least 11 people in the scene, with some standing closer to the man and others further away.  The people are dressed in various clothing, with some wearing ties. The scene is set in a field, and there are trees in the background. The overall atmosphere of the image is solemn and focused on the man's passing.	0.1	0.3793103448275862	0.1582733779928576	0.019444444444444445	0.07954545454545454	0.031249996843112565	0.09090909090909091	0.3448275862068966	0.1438848887842245	0.8053017854690552	0.7030918598175049	0.7507339119911194	0.0	0.09015984545078534
999	The theme of the picture is the Flagellation of Christ by the Romans during his Passion. The biblical event takes place in an open gallery in the middle distance, while three figures in the foreground on the right-hand side apparently pay no attention to the event unfolding behind them. The Flagellation is particularly admired for the realistic rendering of the hall in which the flagellation scene is situated in relation to the size of the figures and for the geometrical order of the composition. The portrait of the bearded man at the front is considered unusually intense for Piero's time.	The image depicts a group of people dressed in red robes, standing in a hallway. There are at least nine people in the scene, with some of them wearing ties. The people are engaged in conversation, and some of them are holding wine glasses. The setting appears to be a formal event or gathering, with the individuals dressed in their finest attire.	0.140625	0.20930232558139536	0.1682242942580139	0.010869565217391304	0.017241379310344827	0.013333328590223908	0.140625	0.20930232558139536	0.1682242942580139	0.7637835741043091	0.7370724081993103	0.7501903176307678	0.0	0.13671875
1001	In the center, lying on a catafalque with a precious cloth decorated with pomegranates, is the body of St. Jerome. He is surrounded by a group of monks, whose faces show their mourning and despair for the saint's death. The mourner's faces show that Lippi had studied Giotto's work in the Bardi Chapel, as some gestures are very similar, such as that of the monks kissing the saint's feet or the one raising his hands. In the foreground is Inghirami kneeling, with a crippled youth in front of him who points at Jerome's body (a trick to avoid that the donor's red garments could distract the observer). The crippled figure is inspired by the frescoes by Masaccio and Masolino da Panicale in the Brancacci Chapel, which Lippi knew well as he had a been a monk in the convent housing the chapel in his youth. The upper part of the panel, aside from rocky mountains with three secondary scenes (Adoration of the Child and two episodes of the saint's life), is occupied by angels, perhaps executed by Fra' Diamante or another collaborator. Among them circles which allude to the Heaven's Circles, the Redeemer (with a book with Alpha and Omega), the Holy Spirit dove and the Jesus opening his arms. At the bottom is the coat of arms of the  Inghirami family.	The image depicts a painting of Jesus being laid in a tomb, surrounded by a large group of people. The people are gathered around the tomb, with some standing closer to the foreground and others further in the background. The scene captures the emotions and reactions of the people as they witness the burial of Jesus. The painting is likely a representation of the Last Supper, where Jesus shared his last meal with his disciples before his crucifixion.	0.12857142857142856	0.35294117647058826	0.18848167147830386	0.03349282296650718	0.09333333333333334	0.049295770761010035	0.11428571428571428	0.3137254901960784	0.1675392631013405	0.8099503517150879	0.7268236875534058	0.7661387920379639	0.0	0.11247197860321252
1025	It portrays St. Francis of Assisi while ideally marrying the three Theological Virtues, Faith, Hope and Charity, through the donation of a ring to them. The three virtues have differently colored dresses: red for Charity, green for Hope and white for Faith; they are also depicted on the left while flying to heaven with sticks in their hands. Behind St. Francis, who wears his traditional brown monk habit, is his companion Fra' Leone. The scene is set in an idyllic landscape, between hills, castles and cultivated fields, without any attention to perspective and realism as in other Renaissance works.	The image depicts a painting of a group of people, including a woman and a man, standing on a hill. The woman is holding a baby, and the man is holding a book. The scene appears to be a religious or spiritual gathering, with the people dressed in religious garments. The painting is set against a backdrop of a mountain, adding to the serene and spiritual atmosphere of the scene.	0.1518987341772152	0.2926829268292683	0.199999995501389	0.030927835051546393	0.045454545454545456	0.03680981113177074	0.1518987341772152	0.2926829268292683	0.199999995501389	0.789231538772583	0.732982337474823	0.7600676417350769	0.0	0.17344573530308802
1026	It shows a nativity scene with grisaille archways and trompe-l'œil sculptured reliefs. The sculpted figures in the archway depict biblical scenes of sin and punishment, signaling the advent of Christ's sacrifice, with an over-reaching message of the "Fall and Redemption of humankind". Inside the archway, surrounded by four angels, is the Holy Family; beyond, a landscape extends into the far background. The background landscape is typically serene, as are what Upton describes as the "charming, almost doll-like figures who make up the cast of characters."The panel is set in a shed enclosed by two pillars and an archway, rendered in sculpture-like grisaille. Each pillar is supported by a relief hunched figure (atlante) at the base, holding the weight on its shoulders. On each pillar stand statues of Adam and Eve – Adam on the left and Eve to the right. A marble threshold connects the two structures. On the top corners of the arch are two spandrels; the archivolts contain six biblical scenes in relief from the Book of Genesis, depicting the Fall of Man. Two are of Adam and Eve; their expulsion from paradise and Adam tilling the soil. In the shed Mary and Joseph share an intensely private moment before the Annunciation to the shepherds of the Christ child's birth to the shepherds. Mary wears a long flowing blue robe, Joseph a green-lined red cape over a brown robe. He holds his hat in hand, and his pattens are respectfully removed, left lying on the ground. Kneeling in adoration to either side are four small angels. Animals are visible in stalls. Behind them is a crumbling wall with three low Romanesque windows. Four shepherds in contemporary 15th-century clothing are chatting amiably, leaning against the wall, looking into the shed. Two are positioned to the left and two to the right; in each pair one is dressed in red and an other in blue. Behind the shed is a small hill where two shepherds herd sheep along a pathway, and beyond is a Netherlandish town with two domed structures in its center, symbolizing Jerusalem and Christ's Passion. A flock of geese is visible high in the sky through the roof's trusses. Light shines into the shed from outside through the low windows. The four onlookers in the rear are in light and shadow, especially noticeable on the face of the man second from the right.	The image depicts a religious scene with a woman in a black dress, possibly a nun, praying while surrounded by several children. The woman is kneeling down, and the children are positioned around her, some closer to her and others further away. The scene appears to be set in a church, with a pew visible in the background. The woman's hands are clasped in prayer, and the children seem to be participating in the religious ceremony.	0.07207207207207207	0.32653061224489793	0.11808117784943023	0.02185792349726776	0.11594202898550725	0.03678160652619916	0.07207207207207207	0.32653061224489793	0.11808117784943023	0.7991994619369507	0.7148593068122864	0.7546802759170532	0.0	0.07591688106340784
1038	The cardinal is portrayed from in a three-quarter position over a dark background, with strong chiaroscuro effects which enhance the volume of the figure, turning it into a king of Roman-style bust in painting. The serious and concentrated glance and the detail of the closed lips underline the strong character of the man, who was not only a politician and diplomat, but also a war leader.	The image features a man wearing a red robe, possibly a cardinal, with a stern look on his face. He is looking directly at the viewer, capturing their attention. The man is wearing a hat, which adds to his distinguished appearance. The scene is set against a dark background, emphasizing the man's presence and the intensity of his gaze.	0.20408163265306123	0.22727272727272727	0.21505375845531285	0.047619047619047616	0.05263157894736842	0.0499999950125005	0.1836734693877551	0.20454545454545456	0.19354838211122685	0.8090724349021912	0.7786273956298828	0.7935580015182495	0.0	0.2271027161259095
1041	The portrait depicts the condottiero by profile and, according to some sources, was based on a medal executed in 1445 by Pisanello, or to one by Matteo de' Pasti from 1450.	A painting of a man with a shaved head, wearing a gold and brown robe, and a black and gold necklace. The man appears to be looking at the viewer.	0.14285714285714285	0.17391304347826086	0.1568627401460978	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.10714285714285714	0.13043478260869565	0.11764705387158807	0.7394464015960693	0.6819854378700256	0.7095544934272766	0.0	0.11173184357541899
1056	The three predellas,  stripped by the French in 1797 along with the main picture (restored to Verona in 1815), are now replaced by copies. Eight saints are placed at the sides, according to the commissioner's preferences: on the left are Peter, Paul, John the Evangelist and Zeno; on the right, Benedict, Lawrence, Gregory and John the Baptist. The entire composition is full of detail referring to classical Antiquity: the frieze with the angels which hold two garlands or the throne, which reminds the viewer of a sarcophagus.	The image features a beautifully decorated altar with a gold frame. The altar is adorned with a painting of Mary and Jesus, surrounded by several other paintings. The scene is set in a church, with the altar being the focal point of the space. The artwork on the altar is a testament to the religious significance of the location.	0.1746031746031746	0.2894736842105263	0.21782177748456044	0.03614457831325301	0.05555555555555555	0.043795615661996364	0.1746031746031746	0.2894736842105263	0.21782177748456044	0.7936021089553833	0.746256411075592	0.769201397895813	0.0	0.1386138613861386

1100	The condottiero, the Italian Niccolò da Tolentino is depicted riding his horse, standing on a classical pedestal painted in geometrical perspective, and flanked by two nude men with coat of arms. The horse and the rider are painted in a different perspective than the pedestal. The horse (differently from the specie's walking pattern) is portrayed while raising both left legs. It is a large and massive animal, inspired by the head of the ancient Riccardi Horse and to Donatello's Equestrian statue of Gattamelata, a prototype of Renaissance equestrian statues. As in Donatello's sculpture, the condottiero stares down the onlooker, to emphasize his power, command and determination in battle. The elegant hat and the flittering cloak area examples of the increasing taste for fine decorative elements in Florentine art, in contrast with the more austere, fresco of John Hawkwood by Uccello completed some 30 years earlier.	The image features a statue of a man riding a horse, possibly a knight or a warrior. The statue is positioned on a pedestal, and the man is holding a sword. The scene is set against a blue background, which adds a sense of depth and contrast to the image.	0.11650485436893204	0.375	0.17777777416076826	0.02142857142857143	0.061224489795918366	0.0317460279051543	0.11650485436893204	0.375	0.17777777416076826	0.8312426805496216	0.7356546521186829	0.780532956123352	0.0	0.10936860125541269

1224	The angel holds a Madonna lily, a symbol of Mary's virginity and of the city of Florence. He left a note for Leonardo to finish the background and the angel.	The painting depicts a scene where a woman is sitting on a bench, holding a book. A young man is kneeling in front of her, possibly asking for her blessing or guidance. The woman is wearing a blue dress, and the young man is dressed in black.  In the background, there are two potted plants, one on the left side and the other on the right side of the scene. Additionally, there are two vases, one located near the center of the painting and the other towards the right side.

1228	The picture depicts the Baptism of Jesus by John the Baptist as recorded in the Biblical Gospels of Matthew, Mark and Luke. The angel to the left is recorded as having been painted by the youthful Leonardo, a fact which has excited so much special comment and mythology, that the importance and value of the picture as a whole and within the œuvre of Verrocchio is often overlooked.	The image depicts a religious scene with a man and a child. The man is holding a crown above the child's head, while the child is kneeling down. The man is wearing a black and white outfit, and the child is dressed in a blue and white outfit. The scene is set in a natural environment, with a potted plant in the background and a bird flying in the sky.	0.14893617021276595	0.1891891891891892	0.16666666173752848	0.014925373134328358	0.016666666666666666	0.0157480265112546	0.14893617021276595	0.1891891891891892	0.16666666173752848	0.7346405982971191	0.7051228284835815	0.7195791602134705	0.0	0.1768707482993197
1232	The work represents a sacred conversation, with the Virgin enthroned and the sleeping Child in the middle, surrounded by a host of angels and saints. On the right low corner, kneeling and wearing his armor, the patron of arts, duke and condottiero Federico da Montefeltro. The background consists of the apse of a church in Renaissance classical style, which is rendered in such meticulous perspective that the feigned depth of the coffer-vaulted apse at the rear can be calculated. At the center, hanging by a thread from the apse shell is an egg, emblem alike of Mary's fecundity and the promise of regeneration and immortality. The Child wears a necklace of deep red coral beads, a color which alludes to blood, a symbol of life and death, but also to the redemption brought by Christ. Coral was also used for teething, and often worn by babies. The saints at the left of the Madonna are generally identified as  John the Baptist, Bernardino of Siena (dedicatee of the paintings's original location) and Jerome; on the right would be Francis, Peter Martyr and Andrew. In the last figure, the Italian historian Ricci has identified a portrait of Luca Pacioli, a mathematician born in Sansepolcro like Piero della Francesca. Modern cleaning has revealed the great detail in characters' clothes, the angels' jewels, Federico's reflective armor and the oriental carpet beneath the feet of the Virgin, reflecting the influence of Early Netherlandish painting. The apse ends with a shell semi-dome from which an ostrich egg is hanging. The shell was a symbol of the new Venus, Mary (in fact it is perpendicular to her head) and of eternal beauty. According to another hypothesis, the egg would be a pearl, and the shell would refer to the miracle of the virginal conception (the shell generates the pearl without any male intervention).	The image depicts a large group of people gathered in a room, with a woman sitting in the center. She is holding a baby, and the people around her are engaged in various activities. Some of the individuals are holding books, while others are holding staffs or other items. The scene appears to be a religious gathering or a social event, with people of different ages and genders participating. The room is adorned with a beautiful ceiling, adding to the atmosphere of the gathering.	0.06349206349206349	0.2222222222222222	0.09876542864197543	0.020833333333333332	0.075	0.03260869224952777	0.06349206349206349	0.2222222222222222	0.09876542864197543	0.7845076322555542	0.704043447971344	0.742100715637207	0.0	0.07664009809932557

1247	Ecce Homo shows Jesus stripped and brought before the people by the members of the Roman council, who are flanked by soldiers. The people mock and jeer Jesus, who wears a Crown of Thorns. His hands are bound with shackles, while the redness of the now raw flesh on his legs, hands and chest attests to the fact that he has been beaten with a scourge. A third inscription Salve nos Christe redemptor (Save us, Christ Redeemer) can be seen in the lower left of the canvass, from the mouths of what were the representations of two donors, but which were later painted over. Most notable are the placing two animals traditionally seen as emblems of evil in Christian iconography—an owl perched above Pilate, and a giant toad seen resting on the shield of one of the soldiers. The upper right quadrant of the composition presents an all-but-autonomous cityscape that represents Jerusalem under the familiar guise of a Late Gothic Netherlandish town. Its large open spaces, eerily empty, form the strongest contrast to the densely packed jostle of grotesquely caricatured and exotically garbed figures of the foreground mob.	The image depicts a scene where a man is being crucified, with a crowd of people gathered around him. The man being crucified is positioned in the center of the scene, with his arms outstretched. The crowd consists of various individuals, some standing closer to the man, while others are further away.  In the background, there is a building that adds to the atmosphere of the scene. The people in the crowd are of different heights and positions, creating a sense of depth and realism in the image.	0.0962962962962963	0.24074074074074073	0.13756613348450503	0.027777777777777776	0.060240963855421686	0.03802280936835915	0.08148148148148149	0.2037037037037037	0.11640211232048388	0.7833647131919861	0.7240757346153259	0.7525542974472046	0.0	0.1401630988786952
1264	The Madonna and Child with the Infant St. John the Baptist is a lost composition by Leonardo da Vinci. The painting depicts the Virgin Mary with arms outstretched and the infant Christ embracing a lamb. The infant John the Baptist is depicted holding a goldfinch, a symbol of the passion. The three figures are shown before a vegetated and rocky landscape and with architectural structures in the distance. The Virgin with her arms outstretched is a common motif among the compositions of Leonardo and his studio.	The image depicts a scene where a woman, possibly Mary, is holding a baby in her arms. She is surrounded by two other babies, one on her left and the other on her right. The woman appears to be a mother figure, providing care and protection to the children. The scene is set in a garden, with a tree in the background and a rock nearby.	0.22641509433962265	0.2727272727272727	0.2474226754554151	0.05	0.0625	0.05555555061728439	0.18867924528301888	0.22727272727272727	0.20618556205335334	0.7927136421203613	0.7592113018035889	0.7756008505821228	0.0	0.2139740300416833
1272	The central and centered motif is the young Virgin Mary seated with Baby Jesus on her lap. Depicted in precious clothes and jewellery, with her left hand Mary holds a carnation (interpreted as a healing symbol). The faces are put into light while all other objects are darker, e.g. the carnation is covered by a shadow. The child is looking up, the mother is looking down — there is no eye contact. The setting of the portrait is a room with two windows on each side of the figures.	The image features a painting of a woman holding a baby. The woman is wearing a blue dress and is positioned in the center of the painting. The baby is being held close to her, and the woman appears to be feeding the baby.

1275	The panel depicts Mary with the  Child on her womb, subject of the  adoration of the three Magi. One of the latter, with a flashing red mantle, is kneeling in front of her; his crown with fur edges lies on the ground next to him, together with a container full of gold coins. Joseph, behind Mary, is perhaps pointing at them with an amazed expression. Behind the first king are another one, also kneeling and aged, and a younger one standing, with black skin. The former, who has a hand on his chest while another is catching the gift, wears a crown above a red velvet beret, and has a fur-lined hood which partially hides a sword hilt. His garments are completed by a saddlebag decorated by two pearls and two daisies. The last king is already holding his gift; he is also dressed sumptuously, including the spurs, and is accompanied by three servants. In the background are several shepherds, including a bearded one with a fur hat decorated by feather, who could be the artist's self-portrait. All the characters' glances converge on the baby Jesus, who, instead, looks towards the observer. Symbolic details scattered in the picture include an iris flower at left and a small still life with a bowl, a pot, a wooden spoon and a piece of bread in a wall niche. At left is a landscape with the Magi procession, with several buildings and lake where grooms and horses are resting. Another portion of landscape is in the middle part, with two shepherds pointing at something, an aged woman and a child: the latter characters could be a reference to St. Elizabeth and the young St. John the Baptist visiting Jesus. In the upper part are two pink and yellow drapes.	The image depicts a group of people gathered around a baby, with some of them kneeling down. The baby is being held by a woman, who is surrounded by the group. The people in the scene are dressed in various styles, with some wearing ties.  There are several bowls placed around the room, with one near the center, another towards the right side, and the third one closer to the left side. A cup can also be seen on the right side of the room. The overall atmosphere of the scene suggests a religious or spiritual gathering.	0.14124293785310735	0.38461538461538464	0.20661156631889904	0.025089605734767026	0.07608695652173914	0.03773584532690151	0.11864406779661017	0.3230769230769231	0.17355371507922965	0.8125820755958557	0.7573944330215454	0.7840182185173035	0.0	0.11424944462075533

1324	It portrays Maria Maddalena Baroncelli, about whom very little is known. Maria is dressed in the height of late fifteenth-century fashion, with a long black hennin with a transparent veil and an elaborate jewel-studded necklace. Her headdress is similar and necklace identical to those in her depiction in Hugo van der Goes's later Portinari Altarpiece (c. 1475), a painting that may have been partly based on Memling's portrait. The half-length portrait shows Maria Portinari (born Maria Maddalena Baroncelli in 1456) in a three-quarter view turned to the left. She is placed against a flat, opaque, dark background, with her hands clasped in prayer. Maria's face is idealised and conforms to contemporary ideals of beauty, especially in the raised eyebrows and elongated nose. Her elbows rest on an unseen parapet that coincides with the lower edge of the painted stone frame, acting as a trompe-l'œil which situates her both in the same reality and in closer proximity to the viewer. Her necklace is colored with mostly red and blue jewels, similar to Hugo van der Goes's portrait of her in the Portinari Altarpiece. The black hennin is long, truncated and relatively plain with a transparent veil which falls around the back of her neck, resting briefly on her shoulder. Probably it was kept relatively unadorned so as not to distract from the necklace. Her costume is mostly black or brown, with a wide but high neckline and white fur lined hems on the sleeves. Portinari has dark eyes, a strong nose, full lips and a pointed chin. Her visible hand, folded in prayer but unrealistically off center, wears what looks like a jeweled ring. The dark sleeves of her dress contain red or rouge velvet-like cloth tightened by a white belt. Her hair is shaved back to achieve the high forehead and sculptural look fashionable at the time. Maria's necklace is gilded and studded with pearls, rubies and sapphires. It contains three open flowers; one white with a ruby jewel, another red with a sapphire, and one gray-blue with a pearl. The upper line contains a row of onyx beads, from which hang, according to the art historian Sophie McConnell "small teardrops" gold and bluish-grey enameled wire.	The image features a woman wearing a black dress and a necklace. She is looking directly at the camera, and her expression appears to be serious. The woman is the main focus of the image, and her attire and facial expression create a sense of intensity and focus.	0.05963302752293578	0.40625	0.10399999776768006	0.011730205278592375	0.08695652173913043	0.020671832530630718	0.05963302752293578	0.40625	0.10399999776768006	0.7998483180999756	0.6824326515197754	0.7364900708198547	0.0	0.04598003152916449

1482	On the right are the Egyptian soldiers, shown in typical Italian Renaissance military garments, armor and weapons, who are drowning  after the Red Sea waters, which had miraculously opened to allow the Israelites to cross them, close around them. The pharaoh is portrayed in a frantic scream, while other figures try to return to the Egyptian shore by swimming. Before the army is a column hovering over the waters: this is a representation of the fire pillar sent by Yahweh to  scare the Egyptians. In the upper central area is a hail storm, sent by God to punish the Egyptians. Also depicted are some sunrays and, more to the left, a rainbow,  symbols of the upcoming liberation for the Israelite people. On the left are the Israelites, led by a young Moses with the typical yellow garment and green cloak, and a command baton, after they have just crossed the sea. They continue their trip in procession, disappearing on the left, in a naturalistic landscape. Details include a pet dog in the foreground, reminiscent of Benozzo Gozzoli's paintings in the Magi Chapel.	The image is a painting of a group of people standing in a flooded area. The people are gathered around a man who is kneeling down, possibly praying. The scene is set in a flooded area with a mix of people and animals, including a horse and a dog.

1486	These keys represent the power to forgive and to share the word of God thereby giving them the power to allow others into heaven. The main figures are organized in a frieze in two tightly compressed rows close to the surface of the picture and well below the horizon. The principal group, showing Christ handing the silver and gold keys to the kneeling St. Peter, is surrounded by the other Apostles, including Judas (fifth figure to the left of Christ), all with halos, together with portraits of contemporaries, including one said to be a self-portrait (fifth from the right edge). The flat, open square is divided by coloured stones into large foreshortened rectangles. In the center of the painting is the porticoed Temple of Solomon. On either side are triumphal arches. Scattered in the middle distance are two scenes from the life of Christ, including the Tribute Money on the left and the Stoning of Christ on the right. The active drapery, with its massive complexity, and the figures, particularly several apostles, including St. John the Evangelist, with beautiful features, long flowing hair, elegant demeanour, and refinement recall St Thomas from Verrocchio's bronze group in Orsanmichele. The building with its arches serves as a backdrop in front of which the action unfolds.	The image depicts a group of people gathered around a man who is kneeling on the ground. The man appears to be holding a key, possibly a key to a building or a religious symbol. The people surrounding him are engaged in conversation or observing the scene.  In the background, there is a building with a dome, which adds to the overall atmosphere of the scene. The people in the image are of various heights and positions, creating a sense of depth and interaction among the group.	0.12686567164179105	0.32075471698113206	0.18181817775629852	0.035	0.08433734939759036	0.04946996051892305	0.12686567164179105	0.32075471698113206	0.18181817775629852	0.7863753437995911	0.7277806997299194	0.7559441924095154	0.0	0.12520841552324666
1490	In the upper part is Moses kneeling on Mount Sinai, with a sleeping Joshua nearby: he receives the Tables of the Law from Yahweh, who appears in a luminescent cloud, surrounded by angels. In the foreground, on the left, Moses brings the Tables to the Israelites. In the background is camp of tents, with the altar of the golden calf in the middle; the Israelites,  spurred by Aaron, are adoring it: the position of some of them, painted from behind, was usually used for negative characters, such as Judas Iscariot in the Last Supper. Once seeing that, Moses, in the center, gets angry and breaks the Tables on the ground. On the right background is the punishment of the idolatrous and the receiving of the new Tables. Joshua, in the blue and yellow, appears with Moses.	The image depicts a lively scene of people gathered in a field, with some of them sitting on a hill. There are numerous individuals in the scene, with some standing and others sitting. The people are engaged in various activities, such as reading books, talking, and enjoying the outdoors.  The field is surrounded by trees, providing a natural and serene environment for the gathering.

1497	In the central panel is Christ as a judge within a celestial sphere, flanked by angels who are playing the Trumpets of Last Judgement, and by the apostles. Below him is the punishment of sinners which, like the Last Judgement of Vienna, continues in the Hell depiction at right. At left is the Paradise, where the blessed souls are being shipped to Eden on a boat with a pink tent. The tower is a symbol of the Fountain of Eternal Youth, a more articulate version of which appears in the Garden of Delights. The central panel is mostly occupied by insect-like demons who torture the men, punishments including burning, eating impure food (the gluttonous) etc., all inspired by Netherlandish Proverbs. The infernal city at right is under siege by demons, while a fire is visible in  the far background.	The image is a painting of a medieval scene, featuring a castle, a church, and a battle. The painting is divided into two sections, with the left side depicting a castle and a church, while the right side shows a battle scene. The painting is filled with various figures, including people, birds, and animals, all interacting with the medieval setting. The overall atmosphere of the painting is one of war and conflict, with the church and castle serving as the focal points of the scene.	0.13541666666666666	0.2765957446808511	0.1818181774052522	0.015037593984962405	0.02666666666666667	0.01923076461954622	0.11458333333333333	0.23404255319148937	0.15384614943322425	0.7887893319129944	0.7328412532806396	0.7597867250442505	0.0	0.17175658731260562
1507	The supper is set in a semi-circular apse, with a horseshoe-shaped table at whose center sits Jesus, the apostles at his side. Judas, as usual, is depicted on the side, from behind; the fighting cat and dog are elements which further stress his negative connotation. The scene shows the moment immediately after Jesus' annunciation that one apostle would betray him. His hearers' reactions include touching their own chests, or muttering to each other. The table has no meals, but a single chalice in front of Jesus; some gilded or silvered kitchenware is shown in the foreground, an example of still life inspired by contemporary Flemish painting and widespread in Florentine art at the time. At the sides, are two couples of figures dressing rich garments. Another dog is jumping on the left. Within the three windows behind the table are three scenes of the Passion: the Prayer at Gethsemane, the Arrest of Jesus and the Crucifixion.

1513	The painting shows an infrequent composition, with the Virgin holding the Child who writes on a book, an allusion to his intervention in the Holy Books. On the right is St. Jerome, recognizable by his cardinal dress, leaving a book on the marble throne where the Madonna sits: in this case this is one of his traditional attributes of knowledge. Jesus wears a pearl-lined coif which can be seen in another Pinturicchio's work of the period, the Crucifixion between Sts. On the right is an open landscape, a typical element of the Renaissance Umbrian school.	The image depicts a painting of a woman holding a child, with a man standing next to them. The woman is wearing a red hat and a brown dress, while the man is wearing a red hat and a red robe. The woman is holding a book, and the man is holding a stick.

1514	It depicts the Virgin Mary breastfeeding the Christ child, a devotional subject known as the Madonna lactans. The figures are set in a dark interior with two arched openings, as in Leonardo's earlier Madonna of the Carnation, and a mountainous landscape in aerial perspective can be seen beyond. In his left hand Christ holds a goldfinch, which is symbolic of his future Passion.	The image depicts a woman holding a baby in her arms. The baby is nursing from the woman, who is wearing a blue dress.

1517	The infant is gazing at his mother whilst she is absorbed in reading the book. The hands of both mother and son are positioned similarly, with the right hands open as in a gesture of blessing, and left hands closed. Mary's blue robe, a color she is often depicted wearing, has the symbolic meanings of purity, heaven, and royalty. In this painting, as in Botticelli's other large series, the Madonna is portrayed as being serious, thoughtful and focused. Botticelli interprets the scene with a sensitivity and love for small details: the set of boxes and the maiolica bowl of lush fruits are depicted as a still life; the pages of the book, the garments, and the transparent veils exhibit a realistic tactile quality.	The image depicts a woman holding a baby in her arms, with a book in front of them. The woman is wearing a blue robe, and the baby is positioned close to her. The scene appears to be set in a room with a window, and there are several books scattered around the area. The overall atmosphere of the image suggests a peaceful and nurturing environment.	0.18292682926829268	0.3488372093023256	0.23999999548672007	0.04201680672268908	0.078125	0.054644804194810624	0.15853658536585366	0.3023255813953488	0.20799999548672007	0.8076390027999878	0.7622528076171875	0.7842898368835449	0.0	0.1688631374669933
1520	Stylistic elements such as the child on one of the Virgin's knees, and the mutual glance, suggest that the work was based on Bellini's Alzano Madonna in the same museum. The Virgin and Child are portrayed as a bust in the foreground, above a typical landscape with towers, castles and a fluvial inlet with a small boat. The bright sky features a series of red cherubims which give their name to the picture.	The image depicts a woman holding a baby in her arms. The woman is wearing a blue robe, and the baby is dressed in white. The scene is set against a backdrop of clouds, giving the impression of a serene and peaceful moment.

1522	It is attributed to Geertgen tot Sint Jans and in the tradition of the devotional images of the "Man of Sorrows", which typically show Christ before his crucifixion, naked above the waist, bearing the wounds of his Passion. The panel has an unusually complex and suffocating spatial design, and depicts the mocking of Jesus, and his grieving mother. Christ is in obvious pain and holds his wounds up for the viewer. He looks out while  white robed weeping angels bear the Arma Christi -objects associated with his crucifixion and death- float around him. Christ stands in his tomb, a stone sarcophagus. His entire body is lacerated and deformed by wounds sustained during his flogging. His eyes stare directly at the viewer, a device identified by the art historian Erwin Panofsky as referring to the biblical text "Behold what I have suffered for you; what have you suffered for me". To his left, Mary Magdalene kneels in prayer. Her arms rest on the sarcophagus, her eyes are downcast, her plaintive expression is a study of grief. At the foot of the cross, Jesus' mother, Mary, laments with arms folded, as large drops of tears pour down her face. She is supported by John the Evangelist with only his head and hands visible, wiping his tears with the back of his hand. Angels dressed in white robes, their eyes swollen with tears, carry the remaining Arma Christi, including the lance, Holy Sponge and the three nails from the cross.	The image depicts a scene of Jesus being crucified, with a large cross in the center. Jesus is shown hanging on the cross, surrounded by a group of people, including a woman who appears to be Mary. The people in the scene are in various positions, some standing closer to the cross while others are further away. The overall atmosphere of the image is somber and reflective of the crucifixion event.	0.12048192771084337	0.40816326530612246	0.18604650810859932	0.024793388429752067	0.08823529411764706	0.03870967399458928	0.10843373493975904	0.3673469387755102	0.16744185694580863	0.8142200708389282	0.7222106456756592	0.7654603123664856	0.0	0.11153023319595523
1531	The panel shows an enthroned Virgin holding the Child. Angels playing instruments flank the throne, while the left hand male figure is presumably the donor. The scene is set before a landscape. Intended as a devotional donor portrait, the panel combines elements of a hortus conclusus, sacra conversazione and Virgo inter Virgines – the latter of which always presents Mary with Saints Catherine and Barbara. The painting depicts the Virgin and Child flanked by saints and angels; the donor kneels to the left of the holy figures. The Virgin sits on a throne beneath a baldachin (canopy of honor) of rich brocade with the child on her lap. In the garden behind her emblem, an iris, is visible. Two angels dressed in liturgical garments with musical instruments stand to either side of the throne; the one to the left plays a portable organ and the one on right plays a harp. The martyr virgin saint, St Catherine of Alexandria kneels in front of Mary to the left; opposite is St Barbara, who sits to the right, reading a missal.

1672	Saint Jerome in His Study is a fresco by the Italian Renaissance painter Domenico Ghirlandaio, executed in 1480 and located in the church of Ognissanti, Florence. Both depicted two Doctors of the Church in their studies, with a number of objects which should mark their role as precursors of humanism. Jerome is portrayed with his head resting on one hand, while writing with the other. The open books and the cartouches, with Greek and Hebrew letters, correspond to his activity as translator of the Bible. On the writing desk is the date (MCCCCLXXX), as well as a sealed letter, glasses, two inkwells (with drops of ink near them), scissors and a candle holder. The desk is covered by an oriental carpet, a luxurious object often depicted by Ghirlandaio, and perhaps also inspired by Netherlandish painters. The objects on the shelves include a cardinal hat, two pharmacist vases, a cylindrical case,  a necklace, a purse, some fruit, two transparent glass bottles and an hourglass. The light comes from the upper right corner, producing a well defined shadow of the saint on the drapery behind him; but also from the foreground, illuminating the objects on the desk.	The image depicts a man wearing a red robe, sitting at a desk and writing. He appears to be an older man with a long beard, and he is surrounded by various books and items. There are several books scattered around the desk, and a cup can be seen placed nearby. The man seems to be focused on his writing, possibly working on a project or documenting his thoughts.	0.11382113821138211	0.2692307692307692	0.1599999958230205	0.016042780748663103	0.04477611940298507	0.023622043360097357	0.10569105691056911	0.25	0.1485714243944491	0.7868180274963379	0.7143131494522095	0.7488146424293518	0.0	0.09394081728511038
1673	The Florence work shows a crucifix on a tall stick, which he used as a prayer aid. His usual lion is shown, as are some birds, a lizard, a squirrel on a branch and one deer chasing another, all of which probably had symbolic meanings. At the top is a rural background with a fortress and a walled city full of guard towers and bell towers, along with other buildings based on famous buildings in Romagna and Venetia which Bellini had seen on his journey to Romagna and the Marche. The central building resembles the Basilica of San Vitale in Ravenna, whilst others are based on the Ponte di Tiberio in Rimini and the Mausoleum of Theoderic in Ravenna.	The image depicts a man sitting on a rock, reading a book. He is surrounded by a natural setting, with a dog nearby and a bird perched on a nearby branch. The man appears to be enjoying his time outdoors, engrossed in his reading material.	0.12345679012345678	0.30303030303030304	0.17543859237765475	0.02631578947368421	0.06976744186046512	0.03821655653211125	0.1111111111111111	0.2727272727272727	0.15789473272853197	0.7862436771392822	0.7051916718482971	0.7435153126716614	0.0	0.12285012285012285
1677	The Virgin Mary and Child are depicted in the foreground and form a triangular shape with the Magi kneeling in adoration. Behind them is a semicircle of accompanying figures, including what may be a self-portrait of the young Leonardo (on the far right). In the background on the left is the ruin of a pagan building, on which workmen can be seen, apparently repairing it. On the right are men on horseback fighting and a sketch of a rocky landscape. The ruins dominate a preparatory perspective drawing by Leonardo, which also includes the fighting horsemen. The palm tree in the center has associations with the Virgin Mary, partly due to the phrase "You are stately as a palm tree" from the Song of Solomon, which is believed to prefigure her. Another aspect of the palm tree can be the usage of the palm tree as a symbol of victory for ancient Rome, whereas in Christianity it is a representation of martyrdom—triumph over death—so in conclusion we can say that the palm in general represents triumph. The other tree in the painting is from the carob family, the seeds from the tree are used as a unit of measurement. Jesus and the Virgin Mary are, in fact, painted yellow, the color of light. The trees are painted blue, an unusual color for trees of any kind.	The image is a painting of a religious scene, featuring a woman holding a baby. The woman is surrounded by a group of people, some of whom are kneeling down. The painting is set in a courtyard, with a building in the background. The scene is depicted in a sepia tone, giving it an old and historical appearance.	0.12403100775193798	0.41025641025641024	0.19047618691113952	0.02926829268292683	0.10714285714285714	0.04597700812377999	0.10077519379844961	0.3333333333333333	0.1547619011968538	0.8242510557174683	0.7354283332824707	0.7773104906082153	0.0	0.1030834992698792

1690	In the background is a rural scene with a city or castle, a three-arch bridge, trees typical of Perugino, hills and a river. The two nude figures in the foreground allude to that in ancient Greek and Roman art - this and the other classical references demonstrate how the work is intended to be decoded by the humanist classical elite of Florence. The standing contrapposto figure is the god Apollo, carrying a baton in his left hand and with a bow and quiver behind him. The identity of the seated flute-playing figure on the left is debated -	The image depicts a painting of two naked men, one of whom is playing a musical instrument, possibly a flute. The other man is standing nearby, and both are surrounded by trees. The scene appears to be set in a forest, with a bird flying in the sky above the men. The painting captures a moment of artistic expression and connection between the two individuals.	0.23880597014925373	0.3333333333333333	0.2782608647017014	0.03125	0.046875	0.037499995200000615	0.19402985074626866	0.2708333333333333	0.22608695165822315	0.7940794229507446	0.7434991598129272	0.767957329750061	0.0	0.2059122514011437
1693	It depicts the Annunciation on the central panel, while the surrounding panels and the outside of the wings are covered in various pairs of male saints. The central panel of this triptych shows the moment of the Annunciation, as the Archangel Gabriel interrupts Mary's prayers to announce her selection. The dove hovering over Mary's head symbolizes the Holy Spirit impregnating her. The bedroom setting is appropriate, since the triptych depicts the moment her marriage to God is consummated. The flowers behind her are traditional symbols for Mary: lilies for her purity and columbine for her sorrow. The wings of the triptych contain an array of saints in verdant landscapes. The upper left panel has Jerome and Francis; lower left, Bernardino of Siena and Anthony Abbot; upper right, John the Baptist and Benedict; lower right, Michael and Christopher. When not in use, the wings would have been closed to conceal the brilliant interior, leaving visible only grisaille portraits of Paul and Bernard resembling statues.	The image is a painting of a religious scene, featuring a woman kneeling and praying. She is accompanied by a man who is also kneeling and praying. The painting is set in a room with a bed in the background. There are several books scattered around the room, possibly representing religious texts or other reading materials.

1694	The scene portrayed is a Holy Conversation, with a high throne where the Virgin and Child sit, placed over a Classical-style pedestal and crowned by a small engraved arch featuring a festoon with vegetables. Mary is reading a Bible, while Jesus holds a white lily, symbolizing her virginity and purity. Over a gilded step are St. John the Baptist and St. Lawrence, surmounted by two flying angels. On the marble step below, Signorelli portrayed a sitting angel playing a lute, perhaps a homage to elements typical of the contemporary Venetian school (such as the San Cassiano Altarpiece by Antonello da Messina). Standing on the foreground pavement are St. Onuphrius and St. Herculanus, the patrons of Perugia.	The image depicts a painting of a group of people, including a baby, a woman, and a man.

1889	An Old Man and his Grandson (Italian: The picture portrays an older man in a red robe, embracing a young child who is also wearing red. They sit in an interior, illuminated against a darkened wall. Behind them at right is a window through which can be seen a generalized landscape, its uneven terrain and winding roads typical of Ghirlandaio's backgrounds. Although the man's fur-lined robe and cappuccio and the boy's elegant doublet and cap indicate a noble heritage, and despite the traditional assumption that the subjects are grandfather and grandson, their identities are unknown. It is possible that the painting was commemorative in purpose, and that the child was a narrative invention intended to emphasize the man's beneficence. The poignancy of the image is dramatized by the contrast between the man's weathered and wise face, and the child's delicate profile. The painting depicts a moment of intimacy between an old man and a child, underscored by the placement of the child's hand on the man's chest, and the man's gentle expression. This show of affection endows the picture with emotional qualities beyond those expected from a traditional dynastic portrait.

2117	The canvas shows an event that took place about 50 years earlier, on 25 April 1444: while the members of the Scuola were processing the fragment through the Piazza San Marco (the square of St. Mark’s), Jacopo de' Salis, a tradesman from Brescia, knelt before the relic in prayer that his dying son might recover. In the foreground, Gentile has painted the confraternity in its white robes, processing at the head of the parade, the large golden reliquary suspended between them, carried beneath a canopy held by four more Scuola members. Although the subject of the picture is ostensibly the miracle itself, the Brescian merchant is hardly visible in the crowd: he kneels in sumptuous red robes, immediately to the right of the last two canopy-bearers. Rather, the subject of the picture might be more accurately described as the procession, with an especial focus on the space of St. Mark’s square and on St Mark's Basilica itself, with its Byzantine domes and glittering mosaics.	The image depicts a large crowd of people gathered in a courtyard, possibly for a religious ceremony or a parade. The people are dressed in various attire, with some wearing red and gold.

2172	The traditional interpretation of the work is based on a late 15th-century poem by Battista Fiera, which identified it as a representation of Mount Parnassus, culminating in the allegory of Isabella  as Venus and Francesco II Gonzaga as Mars. The two gods are shown on a natural arch of rocks in front a symbolic bed; in the background the vegetation has many fruits in the right part (the male one) and only one in the left (female) part, symbolizing the fecundation. The posture of Venus derives from the ancient sculpture. They are accompanied by Anteros (the heavenly love), opposed to the carnal one. The latter is still holding the arch, and has a blowpipe which aims at the genitals of Vulcan, Venus' husband, portrayed in his workshop in a grotto. Behind him is the grape, perhaps a symbol of the drunk's intemperance. In a clearing under the arch is Apollo playing a lyre. Nine Muses are dancing, in an allegory of universal harmony. According to ancient mythology, her chant could generate earthquakes and other catastrophes, symbolized by the crumbling mountains in the upper left. Such disasters could be cared by Pegasus' hoof: the horse indeed appears in the right foreground. The touch of his hoof could also generate the spring which fed the falls of Mount Helicon, which can be seen in the background. The Muses danced traditionally in wood of this mount, and thus the traditional naming of Mount Parnassus is wrong. Near Pegasus is Mercury, with his traditional winged hat, caduceus (the winged staff with entwined snakes), and messenger shoes. He is present to protect the two adulterers.	The painting depicts a lively scene with a group of people, including both men and women, dancing and enjoying themselves. They are accompanied by a horse, which is positioned towards the right side of the image. The people are scattered throughout the scene, with some standing closer to the foreground and others further back. The overall atmosphere of the painting is one of joy and celebration.	0.0975609756097561	0.3333333333333333	0.15094339272338916	0.0234375	0.09375	0.037499996800000275	0.0975609756097561	0.3333333333333333	0.15094339272338916	0.8114175796508789	0.7158069610595703	0.7606194615364075	0.0032430996051937763	0.09470500516402496
2174	The work portrays the Madonna enthroned surrounded by several saints. The theme of the cherubim surrounding the Madonna is a reference to Annunciation.

2207	The Madonna and Child Between St. Francis and St. Nicasius, also known as Castelfranco Madonna, is a painting by the Italian Renaissance artist Giorgione executed around 1504. The picture has all the elements of a typical sacra conversazione, with the Madonna enthroned with the child, with St. Francis to the right and St. Nicasius to the left. However, the extreme height of the throne is most unusual and creates a very different effect from the pictures of this type by Giovanni Bellini and other painters, where the throne is only slightly raised and the figures are at roughly the same level. The armored figure has formerly been identified as the fighting saint St. George or St. Liberalis, patron of Castelfranco. The traditional scheme of composition is lightened by the novel use of such elements as the throne and the landscape, which takes up a good portion of the background.	The image features a painting of a religious scene, with a man and a woman standing in front of a statue of Mary. The man is dressed in a suit, while the woman is wearing a dress. They are both holding flags, with one flag on the left side and the other on the right side of the painting.  In the background, there are two more people, one on the left side and the other on the right side of the painting. The scene also includes a clock on the wall, adding to the historical and religious atmosphere of the painting.	0.15053763440860216	0.27450980392156865	0.19444443986979182	0.051094890510948905	0.08536585365853659	0.06392693595463016	0.12903225806451613	0.23529411764705882	0.166666662092014	0.7888790369033813	0.7204893827438354	0.7531348466873169	0.0	0.18454071695530874

2224	The left panel depicts the prophet Job seated, with a desperate expression on his face, after Satan has defied him to keep his allegiance to God even in the most tremendous afflictions. These include his flock getting scattered in the other panel, while his properties are on fire at the left edge. Further, his skin is covered by blisters, an appropriate element for a painting likely originated as an ex-voto for the end of plague. His wife, dressed in Renaissance garments, is pouring dirty water above him, while a small devil flees in the far background. The right panel shows two standing musicians. The right one, with the drum, is perhaps a self-portrait.	The image is a painting of a medieval scene, featuring a man and a woman.

2225	Saint Peter is enthroned at left, holding a book and with his gold and silver keys on the dais below him, which is appropriately made of petra, stone. Pope Alexander VI, the pope at the time of the battle, presents the kneeling Jacopo Pesaro to him. Pesaro carries a standard with Alexander's coat of arms. Below the saint classical-style sculpted reliefs are shown at two levels. Pesaro has taken off his helmet, which sits beside the dais. Between Pesaro's head and Peter war-galleys can be seen in action, and to the right of Alexander more sea, ending at the town of Lefkada, or perhaps one on Paphos. Undoubtedly the figure of the saint is strongly reminiscent of Bellini's style, as is the pose of the pope. The latter's features were evidently copied from a medal or other image, so he is much less lively in appearance than the bishop, who was probably painted from live sittings. The tablet at centre bottom is a later addition, which identifies the artist and explains the subject (in notably vague terms), reading "	The image depicts a scene where a man is kneeling in front of a man wearing a red robe, who is holding a flag. The man kneeling is wearing a black robe, and there are two other people in the scene, one standing to the right of the man in the red robe and the other standing to the left.

The people are standing in different positions, with some closer to the man kneeling and others further away. The presence of swords suggests that the gathering might be related to a historical event or a reenactment of a past era.	0.21428571428571427	0.15254237288135594	0.17821781692383115	0.07692307692307693	0.041666666666666664	0.05405404949598286	0.21428571428571427	0.15254237288135594	0.17821781692383115	0.7376400232315063	0.7415823340415955	0.7396059036254883	0.0	0.2002737415134956

2240	The painting was previously thought by its owners to represent Galileo but on its discovery a claim was made that it is a self-portrait by Leonardo da Vinci. Alessandro Vezzosi, director of the Museo Ideale Leonardo da Vinci at Vinci said in 2011 that he had excluded the possibility that it was a self-portrait, but that the painting "remains intriguing because it adds a new element to the Leonardo puzzle".Painted in tempera grassa on panel, 60 by 40 centimetres (24 in × 16 in),  it depicts a man in three-quarter view, with a long beard and wearing a dark hat. The painting, in tempera grassa on a wooden panel made of poplar 60 by 44 centimetres (24 in × 17 in) is of a man dressed in a dark garment, wearing a black hat with a small upturned brim. The man's skin is pale, his eyes blue and his hair and beard greying. The figure is set against a dark greyish monochrome background and is brightly lit from the left of the picture, illuminating the right-hand side of the sitters face, and casting a shadow across the left-hand side. The gaze of the figure is turned towards the viewer. The identification of this portrait as Leonardo da Vinci is based upon comparison with several representations of the artist including a very similar portrait in the Uffizi, the red chalk portrait in Turin and the red chalk portrait by Francesco Melzi in Windsor and others. The inscription runs down the left side of the reverse of the painting, rather than across it. There are several areas of abrasion to the surface of the painting, the most serious damage being two scrapes across the face, one of which extends from the nostril across the corner of the eye to the brim of his hat, and another which extends from nostril to pupil. It is apparent that there is some overpainting to the subject's left eye and cheek, and probably the mouth. There is a small curling white feather adorning the hat which is an apparent addition.	The image features a man with a long beard and a hat, possibly a monk. He is looking directly at the viewer, and his beard is quite prominent. The man is wearing a black hat, and his facial hair is quite long. The painting captures the man's gaze and the details of his appearance.	0.10795454545454546	0.5757575757575758	0.18181817915890208	0.03986710963455149	0.23529411764705882	0.06818181570393217	0.10227272727272728	0.5454545454545454	0.17224880116847147	0.8679366111755371	0.7153390645980835	0.7842841148376465	0.0006842821864028308	0.08007352096496266

John holds a scroll bearing Ecce Agnus Dei and points to Christ, who is shown as 'imperator mundi' or 'emperor of the world', holding a cross and an orb. There are gold highlights on the Virgin's veil, whilst behind her is a female saint, most probably her mother saint Anne or perhaps John's mother saint Elisabeth.	The image depicts a painting of a baby holding a ball, surrounded by two women. The baby is positioned in the center of the painting, while the women are on either side of the baby. The baby is holding the ball in its hands, and the women are looking at the baby with interest. The painting captures a moment of curiosity and interaction between the baby and the women.	0.136986301369863	0.2702702702702703	0.18181817735371913	0.03125	0.05084745762711865	0.038709672704266965	0.1232876712328767	0.24324324324324326	0.16363635917190095	0.7707169055938721	0.7055813074111938	0.7367122173309326	0.0	0.1555352241537054

2403	The painting shows a meticulous  depiction of the canale and the bridge near which the reported miracle occurred, and of a number of people who assist to it. The recognizable characters include Caterina Cornaro, queen of Cyprus. Some suppose she is among the kneeling women on the left; however, Catherine Cornaro is the first woman on the left (standing, with a girl to her left). She is praying. The group of gentlemen is perhaps that of Bellini's family, including his self-portrait and that of his brother Giovanni. At the centre is the Bridge of San Lorenzo ("St. Lawrence Bridge"), full of people who are looking at the event. The fondamente (the  roads which flank the Venetian channels) are also crowded, with some people coming on gondolas. Some people have dived and a woman, on the right, is pushing her moorish slave to do the same: however, Andrea Vendramin  has already grabbed the relic and is carrying it to the shore. The buildings are painted with accurate colors, although with no geometrical perspective. Some of them feature the typical inverted cone chimneys of medieval Venice.

2414	The self-portrait is most remarkable because of its resemblance to many earlier representations of Christ. Its sombre mood is achieved through the use of brown tones set against the plain black background. However, the work is not completely symmetrical; his head is slightly right of centre, his hair not quite in the middle——the strands of hair fall differently on either side while his eyes look slightly to the left.	The image features a man with long, curly hair, wearing a brown robe. He is holding a brown object in his hand, possibly a fur or a piece of clothing. The man appears to be looking at the viewer, creating a sense of connection with the viewer.

2454	St. George is portrayed while riding a horse above a wide background, his lance piercing the dragon's head. On the right is a praying princess. A diagonal line connects the princess head, passing through the lance, to the twisted tail of the dragon. The arid terrain of a desert, with a few bunches of herbs, is covered with the remains of the dragon's victims: the  scrawny stump of a woman, a half-devoured dress, a man with amputated limbs, a severed foot and arm, skulls and bones, both of animals and humans. The inhospitality of the place is further enhanced by the presence of vipers, lizards, toads, vultures, as well by the nearly monocromatic use of yellow and pale greens: the only bright tones are those associated with George's metal armor, the horse's harness and the princess' dress. In the background is a fantastic city, Silene of Libya. A crowd is looking at the scene from terraces and open pavilions.

The faintest golden halo miraculously surrounds her head. In her left hand she holds the baby Christ, who embraces her with one arm around her back, the other around her neck. He, an undeniably precious child, looks back over his shoulder with a coy smile. Behind them, a beautifully clear and bright day unfolds. Off in the distance two figures appear to be ambling toward a reflective pond, enjoying the green scenery around them. A large and very impressing structure stands at the end of a long path, which one could presume to be a Catholic church. Its dome and other structural elements common of Catholic architecture add to the already omnipresent atmosphere of religious divinity and grace.	The image depicts a woman holding a baby in her arms.

2551	Little remains of the signature on the first rock in the left foreground, but it has been confirmed as genuine during restoration and can be reconstructed as "[Johannes Bellinu]s. 1505". Saint Jerome is shown reading in the desert, referring to his life as a hermit and as the producer of the Vulgate Bible. A lizard, a squirrel and hare appear among the rocks, whilst in the distance are a ruined Roman bridge and series of arches along with a walled city.

2568	The painting shows the Virgin Enthroned holding the Child in the center, with two flying angels who are holding, above her, an elaborated royal crown made of gold, pearls and gems; this was a Flemish art scheme already widespread in the German area at the time. The throne's backrest is covered with a green drape and by a  baldachin which is also held by two flying cherubim. Below is an angel playing a lute, an evident homage to Giovanni Bellini's altarpieces. Mary is depicted in the act of distributing rose garlands to two groups of kneeling worshippers, portrayed on two symmetrical rows at the sides. The two rows are headed, on the left, by Pope Julius II (who had been approved the German brotherhood with a bull in 1474), crowned by the Child and followed by a procession of religious figures; and, on the right, by the German emperor Frederick III (portrayed with the face of his son and patron of Dürer, Maximilian I), crowned by Mary and followed by a lay procession. The pope and the emperor, considered at the time the supreme authorities of the Catholic world, have previously deposed the papal tiara and the imperial crown, and are now kneeling to receive the Madonna's blessing. Other angels are distributing crowns of flowers, as well as St. Dominic of Guzman (protector of the adoration of Mary and of the Rosary), who stands at the side of the Virgin. Near the left border is the patriarch of Venice,  Antonio Soriano, with the hands joined, and, next to him, Burkard von Speyer, then chaplain of the church of San Bartolomeo, who was also portrayed by Dürer in another painting. On the right, nearby a lush Alpine landscape, is the artist's self-portrait with a cartouche in a hand: here is the signature with a short inscription, reporting the time needed to complete the work (five months). The characters next to the painter are likely   Leonhard Vilt, founder of the Brotherhood of the Rosary in Venice, and (in black)  Hieronymus of Augsburg, the architect of the new  Fondaco dei Tedeschi.	The image depicts a large group of people gathered around a woman who is sitting on a chair. The woman is holding a baby, and the scene appears to be a religious gathering or a celebration. There are numerous people in the scene, some standing and others sitting, all focused on the woman and the baby. The atmosphere seems to be one of joy and togetherness.	0.0663265306122449	0.28888888888888886	0.10788381439024819	0.00964630225080386	0.047619047619047616	0.016042777947182278	0.0663265306122449	0.28888888888888886	0.10788381439024819	0.7823247313499451	0.683487057685852	0.7295737266540527	0.0	0.0603702709954387

2616	It shows a grotesque and wrinkled old woman with one sagging breast hanging out of her crimson robe holding a bag of gold coins with both hands. She has long straight blond hair, glazed eyes, a long nose, a pinched jaw and a mouth with only two remaining teeth, which is twisted in a scornful laugh. Her visible right arm is muscular and out of proportion to the rest of her body, while a dark tuft of hair sprouts from her underarm. Only her hair and the regular and almost noble outlines of her face hint at former beauty. The intense focus of the image is achieved by tight cropping and the contrasting of the lush colouring of the woman's gown and hair against a flat black background.	The image features a woman with a large, prominent breast, wearing a red robe. She is holding a bowl filled with coins, possibly gold coins, in her hand. The woman appears to be smiling, and her facial expression suggests that she is enjoying the moment.

2631	The painting is in the form of a tondo, meaning in Italian, 'round', a shape which is frequently associated during the Renaissance with domestic ideas. The Doni Tondo portrays the Holy Family (the child Jesus, Mary, and Joseph) in the foreground, along with John the Baptist in the middle-ground, and contains five nude male figures in the background. The inclusion of these nude figures has been interpreted in a variety of ways. Mary is the most prominent figure in the composition, taking up much of the center of the image. She sits directly on the ground without a cushion between herself and the grass, to better communicate the theme of her relationship to the earth (?). Joseph is positioned higher in the image than Mary, although this is an unusual feature in compositions of the Holy Family. Mary is seated between his legs, as if he is protecting her, his great legs forming a kind of de facto throne. There is some debate as to whether Mary is receiving the Child from Joseph or vice versa, although it is clear that the former is the case as she has put down the book she was reading. He is in the middle-ground of the painting, between the Holy Family and the background. Similar to the nudes of the background, the meanings of these heads has been the subject of speculation. The frame also contains carvings of crescent moons, stars, vegetation, and lions’ heads. There is a horizontal band, possibly a wall, separating the foreground and background. The background figures are five nudes, whose meaning and function are subject to much speculation and debate. Because they are much closer to us, the viewers, the Holy Family is much larger than the nudes in the background, a device to aid the illusion of deep space in a two-dimensional image. Behind Saint John the Baptist is a semi-circular ridge, against which the 'ignudi' are leaning, or upon which they are sitting. This semi-circle reflects or mirrors the circular shape of the painting itself and acts as a foil to the vertical nature of the principal group (the Holy family). Mary and Joseph gaze at Christ, but none of the background nudes looks directly at him. The far background contains a mountainous landscape rendered in atmospheric perspective.	The image depicts a painting of a woman and a baby, with the woman holding the baby in her arms. The woman is wearing a pink dress, and the baby is positioned in front of her. The painting also features a man, who is standing next to the woman and baby. The scene is set in a garden, with a bench visible in the background. The painting is set in a circular frame, giving it a unique appearance.	0.08542713567839195	0.4146341463414634	0.1416666638336806	0.03235294117647059	0.15714285714285714	0.053658533753718186	0.07537688442211055	0.36585365853658536	0.12499999716701393	0.8257452249526978	0.7324435710906982	0.7763010263442993	0.0016560292112374852	0.08593566179331609

2678	Madonna with Child between Saints Flavian and Onuphrius is an oil painting by Lorenzo Lotto, signed and dated 1508, now in the Borghese Gallery, Rome, Italy. The painting uses the   Holy Conversation composition, with the Madonna and Child in the center between two saints, a scheme widely used by Giovanni Bellini and other Venetian painters of the time. It depicts, on a dark background, a thoughtful Madonna. The Child is rather fat, and is trying to reach St. Flavian of Ricina, painted on the left. The latter is offering Jesus a pierced heart, a symbol of the future Passion. On the right is Onuphrius the hermit, whose character was inspired by Dürer's Christ among the Doctors, which the German artist had painted in Venice in 1506. Other elements recalling Dürer's works include the general asymmetry of the composition, the bright colors and the drapes, which Lotto had previous painted as screwed up paper, and are now instead softer and more colored.	The image depicts a religious scene with a group of people, including a woman holding a baby. The woman is wearing a blue and red dress, and the baby is being held close to her.

2693	It shows similarities to his 1505 Madonna del Prato (London) and his 1510 Madonna and Child (Milan) - all three have a Giorgione-influenced landscape background (here with a shepherd or villager), separated from the figures by a green curtain and with hazy blue mountains in the far background obeying the rules of aerial perspective. The landscape or meadow in the background symbolises the medieval symbol of Mary's virginity, the hortus conclusus.

2700	Its commissioner is unknown, though some hold it to be a variation on another Saint Jerome in Penitence (1506, Paris) by the artist, which has the saint seated in the landscape in a similar pose and in a similar red cardinal's robe.	The image depicts a man sitting on a rock, surrounded by a forest. He is holding a book in his hand, possibly reading or studying. The man is wearing a red robe, which adds a touch of color to the scene. The forest setting and the man's attire suggest a peaceful and contemplative atmosphere.	0.29411764705882354	0.24390243902439024	0.26666666171022224	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.20588235294117646	0.17073170731707318	0.18666666171022236	0.7624395489692688	0.7367632389068604	0.7493815422058105	0.0	0.26716437486193945
2758	The work shows the mythological hero Perseus killing the monster who had entrapped Andromeda. Piero focused on attention to detail in the background, perhaps inspired by the contemporary Flemish school. Details include   the two characters with a turban on the left, the water on the shore, and the fantastic musical instruments.	The painting depicts a scene of a man riding a dragon, with a knight on horseback nearby. The man on the dragon is holding a sword, while the knight on horseback is also holding a sword. The painting also features a group of people, including a man holding a bow and arrow, and a man holding a shield.

2764	It depicts Raphael's friend, the diplomat and humanist Baldassare Castiglione, who is considered a quintessential example of the High Renaissance gentleman. Castiglione is seated against an earth-toned background and wears a dark doublet with a trim of squirrel fur and black ribbon; on his head is a turban topped by a notched beret. The lightest areas are the subject's face seen nearly head-on, a billow of white shirt front at his chest, and his folded hands, which are mostly cropped at the bottom edge of the canvas.	A man with a beard and a black hat is wearing a black coat and a gold chain. He is holding a book in his hand.	0.09090909090909091	0.3157894736842105	0.1411764671169551	0.011764705882352941	0.043478260869565216	0.018518515166324336	0.09090909090909091	0.3157894736842105	0.1411764671169551	0.8103739023208618	0.6996859908103943	0.7509732246398926	0.0	0.10439560439560439
2799	Virgin and Child with Saints The Virgin Mary is shown on a throne, holding the Infant Jesus, between Barbara and Catherine of Alexandria, two saints popular in the early 16th century and considered the most important of the venerated Fourteen Holy Helpers. Jesus leans forward to place a ring on Catherine's finger, a reference to her vision in which she was to given Jesus by Mary in mystical marriage. Other indicators of the saints identities include the broken wheel - which refers to the torture of Catherine- Some effects of texture and light are still discernible, including contrast of the sharp highlights of Catherine's head-dress against the duller highlights of her necklace. For example, Catherine's dress began with an underlayer of dark blue over which a lines of brighter blue was added to create the illusion of vertical folds in the cloth.	The image depicts a painting of three women, with one woman holding a baby. The other two women are also holding babies, creating a scene of nurturing and care. The women are dressed in long gowns, and the painting appears to be a religious scene, possibly depicting the Virgin Mary and her children. The women are positioned in a way that emphasizes their connection to the baby and the importance of their roles in the painting.	0.14736842105263157	0.2916666666666667	0.19580419134432014	0.021897810218978103	0.04285714285714286	0.028985502770193697	0.11578947368421053	0.22916666666666666	0.1538461493862782	0.7836720943450928	0.7378250360488892	0.7600578665733337	0.0	0.16204809722952615
2802	The Alba Madonna is a painting by the Italian High Renaissance artist Raphael, depicting Mary, Jesus and John the Baptist, in a typical Italian countryside. John the Baptist is holding up a cross to Jesus, which the baby Jesus is grasping. All three figures are staring at the cross. The three figures are grouped to the left in the round design, but the outstretched arm of the Madonna and the billowing material of her cloak balance the image. The canvas pattern is visible in the painting and the landscape on the far right was damaged in the transfer process. Done with the utmost secrecy, heavy steel doors were installed and bars were put in the windows of the barren music room. The buildings on the hilltop at the right-hand edge of the composition are caught by a raking light and have been misted by varying degrees of haze to create the illusion of relative distance from the eye – a technique known as aerial perspective. The far mountains are similarly hazed by distance to a rich azure, while the sky above varies in colour from Wedgewood blue, at its apex, to a cool milky-white on the horizon. This range of colours is repeated in the folds and shadows of the Madonna’s blue robes, which at once echo and animate the circular shape of the composition. A monumental, comforting figure, clothed in robes that look as if woven from a piece of fallen sky, she seems like a world unto herself. Although she sits on the ground, which links her iconographically to the tradition of the Madonna of Humility, her statuesque grandeur calls to mind earlier Renaissance images of the Madonna della Misericordia – images of the Virgin as Queen of Heaven and protectress of all humanity.	The image depicts a painting of a woman sitting on a bench with two children. The woman is holding a cross, and the children are sitting on her lap. The painting is set in a field, with a mountain visible in the background. The woman is wearing a blue dress, and the children are positioned on either side of her. The scene captures a tender moment between the woman and the children.	0.09195402298850575	0.42105263157894735	0.1509433932840869	0.025925925925925925	0.1111111111111111	0.042042038974109464	0.08045977011494253	0.3684210526315789	0.13207546875578505	0.8144134879112244	0.7274525165557861	0.7684807181358337	0.0	0.09345794392523363
2804	The picture is of the Virgin Mother, Christ child and infant John the Baptist, one of many paintings by Raphael with this trio.	The image depicts a painting of a woman holding a baby and a small child. The woman is wearing a blue dress and is holding a rose. The baby is being fed a rose by the woman, while the small child is also present in the scene. The painting is set in a room with a bench visible in the background.	0.38095238095238093	0.24242424242424243	0.2962962915432099	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.3333333333333333	0.21212121212121213	0.25925925450617293	0.7583072781562805	0.7733123302459717	0.7657363414764404	0.0	0.2
2810	In the painting, Raphael has created a scene spanning both heaven and earth. Above, Christ is surrounded by an aureole, flanked by the Blessed Virgin Mary and John the Baptist to his right and left (an arrangement known as the Deësis). Other various biblical figures such as Adam (far left, bared chest), Jacob (far right, red robe and sword) and Moses (right, with horns of light and holding tablets of the Ten Commandments) are to the sides. God the Father sits above them all in the golden light of heaven and adored by angels. Below Christ's feet is the Holy Spirit, to whose sides are books of the four Gospels held open by putti. Below, on an altar sits the monstrance. The altar is flanked by  theologians who are depicted debating Transubstantiation. Christ's Body, Blood, Soul, and Divinity is the Holy Eucharist, which is discussed by representatives of the Church; among them are the original four Doctors of the Church (identified by their names inscribed into their halos), with Pope Gregory I and Jerome seated to the left of the altar and Augustine and Ambrose to the right, along with Pope Julius II, Pope Sixtus IV, Savonarola and Dante Alighieri. Pope Sixtus IV is the gold dressed pope in the bottom of the painting. Directly behind Sixtus is Dante, wearing red and sporting a laurel wreath (symbolizing his greatness as a poet). The bald figure reading a book and leaning over a railing in the left hand corner could be Raphael's mentor and Renaissance architect Bramante.	The image depicts a large fresco painting of Jesus and the twelve apostles. The painting is set in a church, and the figures are arranged in a circle around a central figure of Jesus. The painting is surrounded by a group of people, some of whom are standing and others are sitting, all observing the artwork. The scene is lively and captures the attention of the viewers.	0.09375	0.36585365853658536	0.1492537280958393	0.012605042016806723	0.04918032786885246	0.02006688638426916	0.06875	0.2682926829268293	0.1094527330709637	0.8083300590515137	0.7145675420761108	0.7585623860359192	0.0	0.09522098454904779
2816	Holy Family with a Shepherd is a c.1510 painting by Titian, now in the National Gallery, London.	The painting depicts a scene of the Holy Family, with Mary, Joseph, and baby Jesus. The family is surrounded by a group of people, including a man and a boy, who are kneeling down and looking at the baby. The man is holding a staff, and the boy is holding a bow and arrow. The painting captures the warmth and love shared among the family members, as well as the admiration and curiosity of the onlookers.	0.4117647058823529	0.15217391304347827	0.2222222182816831	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.4117647058823529	0.15217391304347827	0.2222222182816831	0.7023544311523438	0.7113790512084961	0.7068379521369934	0.0	0.22471910112359555
2818	The Infant Bacchus or Young Bacchus is a 1505-1510 painting of the Roman god Bacchus as a boy by Giovanni Bellini.	The image features a young child, possibly a baby, sitting on a rock and holding a watering can. The child is wearing a blue outfit and a crown, adding a touch of royalty to the scene. The watering can is placed in the child's hands, and the child appears to be enjoying the moment. The scene is set in a field, with a tree in the background, providing a natural and serene backdrop.	0.2777777777777778	0.1111111111111111	0.15873015464852616	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.2777777777777778	0.1111111111111111	0.15873015464852616	0.677403450012207	0.6429536938667297	0.6597291827201843	0.0	0.14184397163120568
2832	The Child, just awakened, plays a game with the Madonna's veil, with a melancholy Saint Joseph looking on from the shadows. The use of veil in Renaissance paintings, from the Meditations on the Life of Christ, symbolizes the manner in which the Madonna wrapped the Child in the veil from her head at the Nativity and, prophetically, again at the Crucifixion. The Madonna's dress, frame and angle of her head are reminiscent of Justice in the Stanza della Segnatura which was painted about the same time as this painting.	The image depicts a painting of a woman holding a baby. The woman is wearing a red dress and is holding a green cord. The baby is lying on a bed, and the woman is positioned above the baby. The painting captures a tender moment between the mother and her child.	0.13559322033898305	0.27586206896551724	0.18181817739927697	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.13559322033898305	0.27586206896551724	0.18181817739927697	0.7944439649581909	0.7277828454971313	0.7596538066864014	0.0	0.11293634496919919
2836	Placing a parapet, a low wood or stone sill or ledge, between the subject and the viewer is a common feature of early Renaissance Italian portraits, as a useful way of solving "the principal compositional problem" of portraits at less than full-length, how "to justify the cutting of the figure". By having the large sleeve project slightly beyond the parapet, Titian "subverts" the usual barrier effect, bringing the picture space into "our space" as viewers. The turning pose, with the head slightly atilt and an eyebrow appearing raised, exactly halfway across the composition, adds life and drama.	A man with a beard and mustache is wearing a blue robe and looking directly at the camera. He is holding a black object in his hand. The man appears to be the main focus of the image, with the background being blurred.	0.10526315789473684	0.23529411764705882	0.1454545411834712	0.020833333333333332	0.047619047619047616	0.028985503011972898	0.10526315789473684	0.23529411764705882	0.1454545411834712	0.755522608757019	0.7074043154716492	0.7306721210479736	0.0	0.10454545454545455
2840	However, in all of them David focuses attention on the seated Virgin Mary breastfeeding the Christ Child, enthroned in front of a deep forest landscape background. In the far background there is usually a scene related to either the rest or to the journey to Egypt. It has an entirely different composition to the Madrid, New York and Antwerp versions and shows the Virgin feeding the Christ Child with a bunch of grapes, a symbol of the Eucharist, and Joseph shaking a chestnut tree to bring down nuts. The bluish landscape is more broadly painted than in the Prado, Metropolitan and Antwerp examples.	The image depicts a painting of a woman holding a child, possibly Mary and Jesus. The woman is wearing a blue dress and is sitting on a rock. The child is holding a green object, possibly a leaf or a piece of fruit. In the background, there are two donkeys, one on the left side and the other on the right side of the painting. The scene appears to be set in a natural environment, with trees in the background.	0.2222222222222222	0.32	0.26229507712980393	0.050505050505050504	0.06493506493506493	0.05681817689630725	0.19444444444444445	0.28	0.22950819188390228	0.8025239706039429	0.7619308829307556	0.7817007899284363	0.0	0.2850071893223862
2843	Portrait of a Lady, also known as La Schiavona (the woman from Dalmatia), is a 1510–12 portrait by Titian of an unknown woman. Its subject is shown three-quarter length and in relief (inspired by ancient cameos) on a raised section of the parapet.	A woman in a purple dress is standing in front of a painting, which features a bust of a woman. She is holding a piece of paper, possibly a sketch or a reference for her artwork. The woman appears to be the subject of the painting, and her attire and pose suggest that she is the artist herself.	0.2222222222222222	0.20512820512820512	0.21333332834133345	0.047619047619047616	0.03571428571428571	0.04081632163265365	0.19444444444444445	0.1794871794871795	0.1866666616746668	0.766182005405426	0.7241101264953613	0.7445522546768188	0.0	0.18164435946462715
2858	The motifs on the gold background are typical of textile art and turn it into a trompe l'oeil wall hanging, whilst the saint is shown dressed in rich episcopal vestments with jewelled edges, mitre and rings. He holds a bishop's crook and an open book bearing an Italian translation of a quotation from his writings - "Figlioli siate intente amare iddio che avete inante lo exemplio mio" (Little children, be intent on loving God as you have seen in my example).	The image features a man dressed in a green robe, sitting on a chair and holding a book. He appears to be a religious figure, possibly a monk, as he is surrounded by children. There are at least four children in the scene, with some standing close to the man and others further away. The man is holding the book in his hands, possibly reading or discussing its contents with the children.	0.20833333333333334	0.3	0.2459016345068531	0.0125	0.014084507042253521	0.013245028130347034	0.16666666666666666	0.24	0.19672130663800066	0.7638177275657654	0.697929859161377	0.7293888330459595	0.0	0.17222222222222225
2860	It is an allegorical painting which alludes to the transience of beauty and the fragility of human life.	The image features a painting of three naked women standing next to each other. They are positioned in a way that their bodies are intertwined, creating a sense of unity and connection. The women are standing in front of a clock, which is located towards the right side of the painting. The clock serves as a focal point in the scene, adding a sense of time and space to the artwork.	0.4375	0.14893617021276595	0.22222221843285464	0.058823529411764705	0.014705882352941176	0.023529408564706318	0.3125	0.10638297872340426	0.15873015494079123	0.7327694296836853	0.7788040637969971	0.7550857663154602	0.0	0.2008032128514056
2865	There is a carved depiction of the Last Judgement at the top of the frame, and it also displays the donors' coats of arms. The crowded altarpiece depicts the Trinity, with God the Father holding a crucifix with a still-alive Jesus. Above them, in a cloud of light surrounded by cherubims, is the Holy Spirit in the form of a dove. God the Father wears an imperial crown and a wide gilt cloak, lined in green and supported by angels. Below, the human multitudes are divided between religious men and women (left, led by the pope), and laymen, led by the Holy Roman Emperor—a division similar to that already adopted by Dürer in the Feast of the Rosary (1506). At left, near a cardinal who is perhaps interceding for him, is the aged Matthäus Landauer, wearing rich garments and putting down his hat. A peasant, with one of his tools, represents the poor classes. On the right is an enigmatic queen whose face is entirely hidden by a veil, which leaves only the eyes visible. The lower section is occupied by a large landscape with the dawn above a lake, among hills, inspired by landscapes by Albrecht Altdorfer and Joachim Patinir.	The image depicts a large painting of Jesus Christ being crucified, surrounded by a crowd of people. The painting is set in a cloudy sky, giving it a dramatic and heavenly atmosphere. The people in the painting are of various sizes and positions, with some standing closer to Jesus and others further away. The scene captures the emotions and reactions of the people present at the crucifixion, creating a powerful and moving representation of this significant event in history.	0.1259259259259259	0.3148148148148148	0.17989417581254732	0.03684210526315789	0.08974358974358974	0.05223880184339529	0.1259259259259259	0.3148148148148148	0.17989417581254732	0.7962784171104431	0.7380605936050415	0.7660650610923767	0.0	0.11954022988505747
2877	Three of the cardinal virtues are personified as statuesque women seated in a bucolic landscape and the theological virtues are depicted by putti. The fourth wall containing the Virtues addresses both the civil law of the secular state and the canon law of the Church. , she caresses a lion with her left hand while grasping a sapling of black oak with her right. The oak tree symbolizes strength and alludes to the Della Rovere family to which Pope Julius II belonged. On her breast is an effigy of a winged Gorgon to ward off deceit and fraud. Janus-like, her head has two faces shown in profile. Her youthful feminine face looks forward into a mirror. The backward-facing visage of the old man peers into a past for sound judgment predicated on experience. His view is enhanced by the flaming torch held by a putto depicting Hope. Temperance sits on the right. She holds the bridle of restraint and is accompanied by a putto portraying Faith who points upward to heaven with his right hand. Instead, she is depicted holding scales and a sword in a tondo on the ceiling directly above the fresco. The other two frescoes found lower on the wall also portray scenes concerning the law. To the left of the window is a fresco designed by Raphael but executed by his studio. It depicts the Emperor Justinian receiving the civil code known as the Pandects of the Corpus Juris Civilis from Tribonian. To the right of the window, Pope Gregory IX (as portrayed by Julius II) receives the code of canon law known as the Decretals from Raymond of Penyafort.	The image depicts a painting of a group of people, including a man in a white robe, gathered in a room. The painting is set in a room with a doorway, and the people are standing around a table. The scene is reminiscent of a religious gathering, with the man in the white robe possibly representing a religious figure.

Similarly to Raphael's Terranuova Madonna, the Child and the young John the Baptist interact through their  gestures and glances.	The image depicts a painting of a woman holding two babies. The woman is positioned in the center of the painting, with one baby on her left side and the other baby on her right side. The babies are both looking at the viewer, capturing the viewer's attention. The painting is set against a backdrop of a forest, adding a sense of depth and natural beauty to the scene.	0.1836734693877551	0.2	0.19148935671118167	0.045454545454545456	0.046153846153846156	0.04580152171784916	0.1836734693877551	0.2	0.19148935671118167	0.7898750305175781	0.743804931640625	0.7661480903625488	0.0	0.1901840490797546

3032	The painting is presumed to have been commissioned by Niccolò Aurelio, a secretary to the Venetian Council of Ten, whose coat of arms appears on the sarcophagus or fountain, to celebrate his marriage to a young widow, Laura Bagarotto. In an early proposed identification by Charles Hope in a paper of 1976, the painting depicted a bride dressed in white, sitting beside Cupid and accompanied by the goddess Venus. Two women who share a similar physiognomy are seated upon a carved Ancient Roman sarcophagus. This appears to be a fountain modelled along the form of a Roman sarcophagus (the broad ledges here are not found in actual sarcophagi). How the water enters is unclear, though it appears to be an elaborate capped spring through which the steady stream of water escapes through a brass spout sited between the two women. Next to the spigot is a representation of a carved coat~of~arms belonging to Niccolò Aurelio. Between the two women is a small winged boy, who may be Cupid son and companion of Venus, Mercury (important to any Alchemical reading of the painting) or in other less complex interpretations, perhaps merely a putto. This child looks intently into the water immersing a playful hand in it. The woman on the left is fully and richly dressed; her clothing now usually recognised as those of a bride, though in the past they have been said to be typical of courtesan wear. In her hair she wears myrtle, both a flower sacred to Venus and one worn by brides. In contrast, the woman at the right is nude except for a white cloth over her loins and a large red mantle worn over one shoulder. The nude figure sits comfortably on the ledge of the trough/fountain, with one hand resting on it and the other held high, holding aloft a vessel with a wisp of smoke coming out of it (most likely an olive oil lamp held against the morning light). The clothed woman leans over a lidded container whose invisible contents have been described in various and imaginative ways despite the fact that it is not possible to see any contents. Another shallow metal bowl a silver [phiale] sits on the ledge nearer the nude figure and on this some have claimed meaning such as declaring the family crest of Aurelio's bride - the Bagarotto coat~of~arms - were faintly visible inside the bowl. It was generally recognised by the 20th century that somewhat contrary to a natural first impression, if the painting indeed represented figures along the lines of Sacred and Profane Love, the clothed figure was "profane love" and therefore the nude was "sacred love".The carved scenes on the front face of the trough/sarcophagus does not yet have a generally agreed reading. They have been connected with the woodcut illustrations to Francesco Colonna's Hypnerotomachia Poliphili (published in Venice in 1499).The landscape at the left, behind the clothed woman, moves uphill to a what seems to be a walled castle or village dominated by a high defensive tower. There are two rabbits nearby. The landscape behind the nude figure then stretches downhill to include a village dominated by a church tower and steeple on the far side of water. Two men on horses are hunting with a hound, and a hare is chased by the dog; a flock of sheep are tended by a shepherd; and a pair of lovers are in reclined embrace nearby.	The painting depicts a scene of two women sitting on a bench, accompanied by two children. The children are positioned on the left side of the bench, while the women are on the right side. The women are wearing long gowns, and the children are also dressed in similar attire.  In the scene, there are two bowls placed on the bench, one near the left side and the other near the right side. Additionally, there are two apples, one on the left side of the bench and the other on the right side. The painting captures a moment of togetherness and bonding between the women and the children.	0.07255520504731862	0.5	0.12672176087213233	0.024667931688804556	0.16455696202531644	0.04290428816167273	0.0694006309148265	0.4782608695652174	0.12121211899885408	0.8216303586959839	0.7006728649139404	0.7563461661338806	0.0	0.0799243726366449
3049	The lines lead to a single vanishing point in the center of the mantelpiece above Christ's head, though outside the room, the small side room has its own vanishing point, and neither it nor the vanishing point of the main room falls on the horizon of the landscape seen through the windows. In this central panel, Bouts has introduced the idea of a group portrait around a table, a theme known to council members in Haarlem. Christ is depicted larger than life in the role of a priest performing the consecration of the Eucharistic host from the Catholic Mass. The men around him are shown a half-size smaller, and probably are accurate portraits of prominent members of the confraternity. Bouts main contribution to Flemish painting was his introduction of everyday details in the main panel such as the houses on the other side of the market square that can be seen through the windows, and the servants dressed in modern clothing beyond the central scene around the table. Although once identified as the artist himself and his two sons, these servants are most likely more portraits of the confraternity's members responsible for commissioning the altarpiece.	The image depicts a large group of people gathered around a dining table, possibly for a religious ceremony or a feast. The table is filled with various items, including multiple cups, bowls, and a knife. The people are seated on chairs surrounding the table, with some standing nearby.

3127	According to Vasari the musical instruments strewn about Cecilia's feet were not painted by Raphael, but by his student, Giovanni da Udine. The central figure, St. Cecilia, seems rapt in such inspiration as produced her image in the painter's mind; her deep, dark, eloquent eyes lifted up; her chestnut hair flung back from her forehead — she holds an organ in her hands — her countenance, as it were, calmed by the depth of its passion and rapture, and penetrated throughout with the warm and radiant light of life. She is listening to the music of heaven, and, as I imagine, has just ceased to sing, for the four figures that surround her evidently point, by their attitudes, towards her; particularly St. John, who, with a tender yet impassioned gesture, bends his countenance towards her, languid with the depth of emotion. At her feet lie various instruments of music, broken and unstrung.	The painting depicts a group of people, including a woman holding a musical instrument, possibly a harp. The woman is wearing a yellow dress, and the other individuals are dressed in various attire. The scene appears to be set in a field, with a book and a cup visible in the image. The people are standing close to each other, creating a sense of togetherness and camaraderie.	0.10526315789473684	0.2553191489361702	0.1490683188472668	0.013513513513513514	0.030303030303030304	0.018691584519172952	0.08771929824561403	0.2127659574468085	0.1242235983503724	0.7740753889083862	0.7162915468215942	0.7440633177757263	0.0	0.10263929618768329

3164	The Virgin is standing on a pedestal which includes harpies sculpted in relief, from which the painting takes its name. The figures have a Leonardo-like aura, with a pyramid shaped composition. The harpies, figures from pagan mythology (or locusts), here represent temptation and sin, which the Virgin has conquered and stands upon. The Christ Child is shown as unusually old, and has an athletic contrapposto pose. He looks down to the putti, and all three have a "mischiefness" that contrasts with the serious, abstracted, air of the adults.

3168	The painting depicts the story of Susanna from the Old Testament. Lotto portrayed her after getting naked for the bath (the clothes scattered around her), while the Elders burst into from the door of the bath's enclosure, followed by two serf called to support their accusation of adultery. The cartouches, showing the characters' dialogue, are an archaic element, perhaps required by the commissioner himself as a complement of the moral message. The upper part of the picture is occupied by a view of the garden and a castle within an idyllic landscape.	The image depicts a painting of a group of people, including a woman and a man, who are gathered around a table.

Above is God the Father, who is about to be handed a crown for Mary by the angel to the right (see above). The sky contrasts with the golden heavenly light in the upper zones, which recalls the gold ground traditional in mosaics such as those still being made in San Marco, and the gold ground paintings of the Gothic period.

3211	It shows the Ancient Romean heroine Lucretia (died c. 510 BC), wife of Lucius Tarquinius Collatinus, in a tall and narrow framing, in the act of killing herself rather than  face the shame of being raped by her cousin Sextus Tarquinius. Lucretia stands in front of a cramped and harshly lit room containing the bridal bed on which she was raped. She looks to the sky, as if asking the gods to witness her suicide. Her face betraying feelings of disgrace, as she stabs herself with a sword to the belly. Her wound is not at the center of her belly, as in the 1508 drawing, but below her right breast, echoing Christ's lance wound. The white drapery around her hips is a later addition, from around 1600. Her face bears elements of idealisation, although for the most part she is presented as a real woman. Art historian Fedja Anzelewsky described her as "a parody rather than an exaltation of the classical feminine figure."The feminist scholar Linda Hults observes how "there is a mechanical quality to Lucretia's suicidal gesture; it seems to operate apart from her facial expression, and it does not seem to require the assistance of her other arm, which is oddly placed behind her back."	A naked woman is standing in a room, holding a knife in her hand. She is wearing a green and white towel, and there is a bed in the background. The woman appears to be posing for a painting, as she is the main focus of the image.	0.11267605633802817	0.45714285714285713	0.18079095727919822	0.029556650246305417	0.1276595744680851	0.047999996946880195	0.1056338028169014	0.42857142857142855	0.16949152225094963	0.8008415699005127	0.6960235238075256	0.744762659072876	0.0	0.11882156443844759
3221	The woman is pictured with an oriental style hat and bare breasts. She is making the gesture to cover her left breast, or to turn it with her hand, and is illuminated by a strong light coming from outside. Her left arm has a narrow band carrying the signature of the artist, RAPHAEL URBINAS. It has been suggested that the right hand on the left breast reveals a cancerous breast  tumour disguised in a classic pose of love. Another speculation is that she is touching her left breast to remind herself which side she last fed her child on, the child being Raphael's.	The image features a woman with a pearl necklace, wearing a brown hat and a white dress. She is holding a baby in her arms, and her breasts are exposed.

3249	The work depicts the theme of the Assumption of Mary with two  registers: the lower one shows the apostles of Jesus crowding around Mary's empty sepulcher, looking at her while she ascends to heaven in a cloud in the upper part, surrounded by happy puttoes. Andrea del Sarto painted two kneeling apostles in the middle, according to the traditional pyramidal composition of holy Conversations, joining them to a circle of other apostles which can be seen, for example, in Raphael's Oddi Altarpiece. The presence of a grotto at the right is unusual. Mary is looking upwards, surrounded by a celestial light . At her sides are two symmetrical groups of angels, whose tables perhaps were intended to contain the artist's signature, the donor's name and the execution year; another, in the middle, calls the apostles' attention towards Mary. The apostle kneeling and looking towards the seer, for example, is sometimes identified as Andrea del Sarto's self-portrait.	The image depicts a religious scene with a group of people gathered around a man who is kneeling down. The man appears to be praying, and there are several other people in the scene, some of whom are also kneeling. The people are positioned around the man, with some standing closer to him and others further away.

3260	The Portrait of an African Man (Dutch: Portret van een Afrikaanse man) also known as Portrait of a Moor (Dutch: Portret van een Moor)  is a painting by the Netherlandish Renaissance painter Jan Mostaert. The exact subject of the painting has long been unclear, although numerous ideas have been put forward, including that the depicted figure is a soldier, a nobleman or Saint Maurice.

3352	St. Jerome in His Study is an oil on panel  painting by German Renaissance artist Albrecht Dürer, completed March 1521. Among Dürer's depiction of St. Jerome,  this is the one more resembling a portrait, with little space left for the study and its details (such as in his 1514 etching, where the saint is a small figure in the background). The subject is portrayed with great care for details, including the wrinkles to the white-yellowish beard. Also differently from the etching, the memento mori suggestion of the finger above a skull has a greater visual relevance. Details in the foreground include the inkpot at right and the bookrest at left, as well as a crucifix on the top left.	A man with a long beard and a red hat is sitting in front of a book. He is pointing at a skull, which is placed on a table in front of him.

3360	The Body of the Dead Christ in the Tomb is an oil and tempera on limewood painting created by the German artist and printmaker Hans Holbein the Younger between 1520–22. The work shows a life-size, grotesque depiction of the stretched and unnaturally thin body of Jesus Christ lying in his tomb. Holbein shows the dead Son of God after he has suffered the fate of an ordinary human. The painting is especially notable for its dramatic dimensions (30.5 cm x 200 cm), and the fact that Christ's face, hands and feet, as well as the wounds in his torso, are depicted as realistic dead flesh in the early stages of putrefaction. His body is shown as long and emaciated while eyes and mouth are left open. Christ is shown with three visible wounds; on his hand, side and feet. Discussing the artist's use of unflinching realism, Bätschmann and Griener noted that Christ's raised and extended middle finger appears to "reach towards the beholder", while his strands of hair "look as if they are breaking through the surface of the painting". Above the body, angels holding instruments of the Passion bear an inscription in brush on paper inscribed with the Latin words "IESVS·NAZARENVS·REX·IVDÆORVM" (Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews).	The image depicts a man lying on a bed, with a large wound on his back. The wound appears to be bleeding, and the man is in a vulnerable position. The scene is quite dramatic and evokes a sense of pain and suffering.	0.10071942446043165	0.45161290322580644	0.1647058793709343	0.014925373134328358	0.07142857142857142	0.024691355165371465	0.10071942446043165	0.45161290322580644	0.1647058793709343	0.8156166076660156	0.6998196840286255	0.753294050693512	0.0	0.07420187440485142

3386	Ariadne has been left on the island of Naxos, deserted by her lover Theseus, whose ship sails away to the far left. She is discovered on the shore by the god Bacchus, leading a procession of revelers in a chariot drawn by two cheetahs (these were probably modelled on those in the Duke's menagerie and were tigers in Ovid's original text). Bacchus is depicted  in mid-air as he leaps out of the chariot to protect Ariadne from these beasts. In the sky above the figure of Ariadne is the star constellation Corona Borealis (Northern crown). Falling in love with Ariadne on first sight, he leaps from his chariot, drawn by two cheetahs, towards her. Ariadne had been abandoned on the Greek island of Naxos by Theseus, whose ship is shown in the distance.

3492	The head of the Emperor Hadrian in the right-hand foreground probably does represent a piece Odoni owned, a cast of piece now in Naples. The man wears a rich, dark, fur-lined jacket. He sits next to a table, on which there lies a book and some ancient coins. In his hand he holds a small statue of Diana of Ephesus. The other hand touching the heart is a gesture characteristic of Lotto's work.	The image features a man wearing a fur coat, sitting at a table with a collection of books and a cup. He is surrounded by several statues, including a statue of a man with a beard. The man appears to be in a relaxed position, possibly enjoying a meal or a drink. The scene is set in a room with a dining table and a chair.	0.17857142857142858	0.23809523809523808	0.20408162775510216	0.027777777777777776	0.03333333333333333	0.030303025344353425	0.17857142857142858	0.23809523809523808	0.20408162775510216	0.816750168800354	0.7565412521362305	0.7854936122894287	0.0	0.18902439024390244
3495	The two biblical ancestors are portrayed, in two different panels, on a dark background, standing on a barely visible ground. Both hold two small branches which cover their sexual organs. Eve holds the traditional apple, with the snake coming to her from above from the tree of life. Adam is shown scratching the right crown part of his scalp.	The image features two naked figures, one on the left and the other on the right, each holding an apple. The figures are depicted in a dark, moody setting, with the apple in the right figure's hand being larger than the one in the left figure's hand. The overall atmosphere of the image is mysterious and intriguing.	0.22	0.2894736842105263	0.24999999509297527	0.03508771929824561	0.038461538461538464	0.0366972427169437	0.2	0.2631578947368421	0.2272727223657026	0.79168301820755	0.787513017654419	0.7895925641059875	0.0	0.23580191224206398
3497	Pontormo depicts the Annunciation, the revelation to Mary by the Archangel Gabriel that she would conceive a child to be born the Son of God, in a lively composition, with both figures in an elastic contrapposto.	The image features a large, ornate altar with a painting of a man on it. The painting is surrounded by a beautiful mosaic design, adding to the intricate and artistic nature of the altar. The altar is situated in a church, and the painting of the man is likely a depiction of Jesus. The overall atmosphere of the scene is one of reverence and admiration for the artistry and religious significance of the altar.	0.23333333333333334	0.16666666666666666	0.19444443958333346	0.02857142857142857	0.014705882352941176	0.019417471241399847	0.16666666666666666	0.11904761904761904	0.13888888402777794	0.7478606700897217	0.7326194047927856	0.7401615381240845	0.0	0.20408163265306123

A man wearing a black hat and a robe is sitting at a table, holding a small box. The table is surrounded by various objects, including a clock, a book, and a pair of scissors. The man appears to be focused on the box he is holding, possibly examining its contents or preparing to open it.	0.20833333333333334	0.11627906976744186	0.14925372674537773	0.04	0.018518518518518517	0.025316451369973497	0.16666666666666666	0.09302325581395349	0.11940298047672104	0.7496472597122192	0.7626452445983887	0.7560904026031494	0.0	0.20562181422279407
3508	It depicts Venus sleeping with her son Eros. Behind them, a satyr is caught while discovering the goddess.	The painting depicts a scene of a woman lying on a bed, with two men standing on either side of her. One of the men is holding a blue object, possibly a hat, over the woman's head. The woman appears to be sleeping, while the men seem to be watching over her. The painting also features a bird, which is located near the woman's head.	0.3888888888888889	0.17073170731707318	0.2372881313530595	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.3888888888888889	0.17073170731707318	0.2372881313530595	0.7477240562438965	0.772060751914978	0.7596975564956665	0.0	0.2075471698113208
3537	On the left, "Law" side of the Gotha painting, a naked man is tormented by a demon and a skeleton (Death) as they force him toward Hell. Other motifs on the left include Christ in Judgment, the Fall of Man, the Brazen Serpent, and Moses with his tablets. On the right, "Gospel" side, a man interacts with John the Baptist, who is pointing to Jesus as if to say, "He died for you." He stands before both Christ on the Cross and the Risen Christ, whose blood streams onto the man, through the Dove (Holy Spirit), making Christ's blood into "the saving waters of baptism". The Lamb of God stands atop the trampled demons from the left half. A tree divides the two halves of the panel, shown dying on the left side but living on the "Gospel" side. The two panels can be read somewhat differently: it is easier for the viewer to identify with the man when he is the centered subject. Temporally, the Gotha panel shows two men simultaneously facing the consequences of past actions, while the man in the Prague panel clearly has a choice before him. The painting includes many of the same symbols as the Gotha panel, such as the Brazen Serpent, Moses (at top left), the Fall, and the Crucified and Risen Christ. The Virgin now stands on a hill at right.	The image is a painting featuring a group of people, including a man and a woman, standing in front of a tree. The man is wearing a robe, and the woman is holding a book. There are several other people in the scene, some of whom are also holding books. The painting also includes a snake, which is located near the bottom right corner of the image. The overall atmosphere of the painting suggests a religious or spiritual theme.	0.08450704225352113	0.25	0.12631578569750704	0.03271028037383177	0.09090909090909091	0.04810996174395704	0.07746478873239436	0.22916666666666666	0.11578946990803338	0.8211958408355713	0.7327183485031128	0.774438202381134	0.0	0.10882238631947146
3540	The painting depicts a man wearing armor in a small room with two mirrors. He lies diagonally on a shelf, one hand pointing at his reflected image.	The image features a man with curly hair sitting in a room, possibly a barber shop. He is wearing a black outfit and appears to be relaxed. Another person is visible in the background, possibly a barber or a customer. The room is furnished with a chair and a cup, which is placed on a surface nearby. The overall atmosphere of the scene suggests a casual and comfortable environment.	0.4	0.20833333333333334	0.27397259823606684	0.11538461538461539	0.045454545454545456	0.06521738724952766	0.4	0.20833333333333334	0.27397259823606684	0.7830366492271423	0.8327263593673706	0.8071174621582031	0.0	0.23054755043227668
3554	Io, daughter of Inachus, the first king of Argos, is seduced by Jupiter (Zeus in Greek), who hides behind the dunes to avoid hurting the jealous Juno (Hera in Greek). He is embracing the nymph, his face barely visible above hers. She is pulling Jupiter's vague, smoky hand towards herself with barely contained sensuality; this is a sensual painting, depicting one of the many loves of the god. Noteworthy is the contrast between the evanescent figure of the immaterial Jupiter, and the sensual substance of Io's body, shown lost in an erotic rapture which anticipates the works of Bernini and Rubens.	The image features a beautiful woman lying on a bed, with a large brown dog lying next to her. The woman appears to be enjoying a relaxing moment with her pet. The bed is situated in a room with a potted plant nearby, adding a touch of greenery to the scene.	0.09210526315789473	0.19444444444444445	0.12499999563775525	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.09210526315789473	0.19444444444444445	0.12499999563775525	0.7590851783752441	0.7057440280914307	0.7314434051513672	0.0	0.07423580786026202
3557	The souls of humans rise and descend to their fates, as judged by Christ who is surrounded by prominent saints. Altogether there are over 300 figures, with nearly all the males and angels originally shown as nudes; many were later partly covered up by painted draperies, of which some remain after recent cleaning and restoration. In the lower part of the fresco, Michelangelo followed tradition in showing the saved ascending at the left and the damned descending at the right. In the upper part, the inhabitants of Heaven are joined by the newly saved. The fresco is more monochromatic than the ceiling frescoes and is dominated by the tones of flesh and sky. The cleaning and restoration of the fresco, however, revealed a greater chromatic range than previously apparent. Orange, green, yellow, and blue are scattered throughout, animating and unifying the complex scene. At the centre of the work is Christ, shown as the individual verdicts of the Last Judgement are pronounced; he looks down towards the damned. To the left of Christ is his mother, Virgin Mary, who turns her head to look down towards the Saved, though her pose also suggests resignation. Preparatory drawings show her standing and facing Christ with arms outstretched, in a more traditional intercessory posture. Surrounding Christ are large numbers of figures, the saints and other saved souls. On a similar scale to Christ are John the Baptist on the left, and on the right Saint Peter, holding the keys of Heaven and perhaps offering them back to Christ, as they will no longer be needed. Several of the main saints appear to be showing Christ their attributes, the evidence of the martyrdom. Other prominent saints include Saint Bartholomew below Peter, holding the attribute of his martyrdom, his own skin. They arise from their graves at bottom left, and some continue upwards, helped in several cases by angels in the air (mostly without wings) or others on clouds, pulling them up. Others, the damned, apparently pass over to the right, though none are quite shown doing so; there is a zone in the lower middle that is empty of souls. A boat rowed by an aggressive Charon, who ferried souls to the Underworld in classical mythology (and Dante), brings souls to land beside the entrance to Hell; his threatening them with his oar is a direct borrowing from Dante. In the centre above Charon is a group of angels on clouds, seven blowing trumpets (as in the Book of Revelation), other holding books that record the names of the Saved and Damned. To their right is a larger figure of a soul who has just realized that he is damned, and appears paralyzed with horror. Two devils are pulling him downwards. To the right of this devils pull down other souls; some are being pushed down by angels above them.	The image depicts a large fresco painting on the ceiling of a building, featuring numerous naked figures. The painting is set in a lush green field, with the figures scattered throughout the scene. Some of the figures are closer to the viewer, while others are further away, creating a sense of depth and dimension. The painting showcases a variety of poses and expressions, capturing the viewer's attention and admiration.	0.06513409961685823	0.3541666666666667	0.11003235983535997	0.013761467889908258	0.09090909090909091	0.02390438018634647	0.06513409961685823	0.3541666666666667	0.11003235983535997	0.8068137764930725	0.7149654626846313	0.7581177949905396	0.0	0.0604676984144281
3583	Portrait of an Unknown Gentleman or Man in a Black Beret Holding a Pair of Gloves is a 1530s oil on panel painting by the French artist Corneille de Lyon.	The image features a man dressed in a black outfit, possibly a monk, with a stern expression on his face. He is holding a book in his hand, possibly a Bible, and appears to be looking directly at the viewer. The man's attire and the book he is holding suggest a religious or scholarly context.	0.2222222222222222	0.15	0.17910447280017833	0.034482758620689655	0.019230769230769232	0.02469135342783198	0.18518518518518517	0.125	0.14925372653152166	0.7378101944923401	0.7140770554542542	0.7257496118545532	0.0	0.19005847953216373
3584	The countess is portrayed on a black background, wearing a precious scarlet dress, a frilled mousseline on the chest, and rich  set of jewels. She looks to the right, ideally towards the portrait of her husband. The countess is surrounded by her three sons, Troilo, Federico and Ippolito. The three sons appear to be from different hands, and were perhaps added in different moments.	The image features a woman dressed in a red and gold gown, standing in front of a group of children. She is holding a chain in her hand, and the children are gathered around her, possibly listening to her or admiring her attire. The woman appears to be the center of attention, and the children seem to be enjoying her company.	0.22916666666666666	0.275	0.2499999950413224	0.01639344262295082	0.017543859649122806	0.016949147548119825	0.22916666666666666	0.275	0.2499999950413224	0.8026267290115356	0.7593221664428711	0.7803741097450256	0.0	0.2600518830789233
3617	Although she is portrayed as a beautiful, much younger woman, the viewer is left in no doubt as to her elevated social status and cultural sophistication. She has a small rounded mouth, large oval eyes and dark, arched eyebrows. She has pale skin but rosy cheeks, and a dimple at the end of her chin. There is a duality in her facial expression; although she has soft features, her strong and forceful personality is evident, accentuated by the fact that her body is stiff and she sits upright, giving her an air of the imperious. Her red hair is bound in an updo, and she wears a sumptuous balzo headdress. Her gown is richly embroidered with velvet over a ribbon-edged guimp. She is holding an ermine zibellino and her sleeves are decorated with gold and silver brocade.	A woman wearing a white and black dress is sitting in front of a painting. She is holding a fur stole, which is draped over her shoulders. The woman appears to be the main subject of the painting, and she is looking directly at the viewer.	0.14893617021276595	0.3888888888888889	0.21538461137988169	0.05223880597014925	0.15555555555555556	0.078212286738866	0.1276595744680851	0.3333333333333333	0.18461538061065094	0.7974733114242554	0.7447095513343811	0.7701888084411621	0.0	0.12843642921985202
3618	The count  is portrayed standing in front of  a precious damask cloth background. He wears a long and wide, fur-lined black jacket, a waistcoat in the same color, a white shirt and white trousers with "French" cuts. The latter, according to the contemporary fashion, are padded above the groin. His austere posture and the hand at the sword's hilt refer to Pier Maria's military career. He looks to the right, ideally towards his wife's portrait. At the right is a landscape with a city rich of monuments, perhaps Rome. The objects are also references to the count's life and personal interests: a statue of Mars, the Roman war god, an ancient bas-relief (symbol of his collector attitude), and some books, hinting to his love for literature (he was in  correspondence  of poet Pietro Aretino). One of the books has the inscription "Imperio", referring to Pier Maria's commitment  with emperor Charles V at the time in which the work was painted.	The image features a man dressed in a suit and a fur coat, standing in front of a statue. He is wearing a chain and holding a scepter, giving him an air of authority. The man appears to be the main focus of the scene, with the statue in the background. The overall atmosphere of the image suggests a sense of power and importance.	0.13513513513513514	0.36585365853658536	0.19736841711305406	0.045454545454545456	0.11290322580645161	0.06481481072187954	0.12612612612612611	0.34146341463414637	0.184210522376212	0.8067401051521301	0.7346814870834351	0.7690264582633972	0.02127357121401541	0.13741503276360056
3620	The eyes are narrowly set, he tightly grips the seal. The table reaches into the immediate foreground as if reaching into the viewer's personal space. Cromwell sits on a bench before a table holding a legal document. His left hand has a patterned gold ring with a large green gemstone. He is dressed in sober colours, comprising a black fur lined overcoat, a black hat and a "severe expression". The table is covered with a green cloth. Some of his effects are placed on it, including a quill, a devotional book, scissors and a leather bag.

3625	The painting depicts a bedroom where an Annunciation takes place following an unusual scheme: the angel is on the right, holding a white lily, and has got in from a loggia which opens to a garden  (the hortus conclusus). His right arm is pointing at the Father God who has shown in a cloud and is blessing Mary from inside the loggia. Mary is portrayed in the left foreground, looking at the spectator and raising her hands in a surprised gesture. The Madonna who face the seer and the angel who tries to draw her attention are taken instead from Titian works. Lotto's Virgin is a good girl; the message takes her by surprise while praying in her room; she cannot even turn her head; her gesture, almost a defensive one, is that of somebody who is struck at the back by a sudden call	The image depicts a scene from the Bible, where an angel is flying through the air, and a woman is standing in front of a bookshelf. The woman is holding her hands up, possibly in a gesture of prayer or worship. The bookshelf is filled with various books, and a cat is also present in the scene, sitting on the floor near the woman.

3629	In The Virgin of the Navigators, Mary is depicted spreading her mantle over the Spanish. She straddles the seas, uniting the continents, or hovers over the harbor to protect ships, cargo and crew as they embark on the perilous Atlantic crossing. Ferdinand II of Aragon and the emperor Charles V (cloaked in red), are portrayed together with Christopher Columbus, Amerigo Vespucci and one of the Pinzón Brothers, shown kneeling. All soar on clouds above the water beneath the Virgin's feet. Around the Virgin gather figures of indigenous peoples of the Americas, converted from their original faiths by the navigators who have set sail in her name: the painting "may be the fullest statement of the approved Spanish ideology, which might be called 'the White Legend of Spain's Imperial Election' ".Flanking	The image depicts a painting of a woman, possibly Mary, Queen of Scots, standing on a boat surrounded by a crowd of people. The woman is wearing a long dress and appears to be holding a baby. The people surrounding her are of various heights and positions, creating a lively atmosphere.

3637	It depicts a woman, taken from three-quarters on a dark background, who wears an Arabesqued dress and a large, plumed hat in the contemporary fashion, which appears in variants in paintings by Cranach as well as by other German artists of the time.	The image features a woman wearing a fancy dress and a red hat. She is adorned with a chain around her neck, and her outfit includes a ruffled collar. The woman appears to be the center of attention, possibly in a portrait or a painting. The scene is set against a black background, which further emphasizes the woman's attire and the overall composition of the image.	0.2777777777777778	0.2127659574468085	0.24096385050950803	0.07142857142857142	0.046153846153846156	0.05607476158616514	0.2222222222222222	0.1702127659574468	0.1927710794251707	0.8089607954025269	0.7844762802124023	0.7965304255485535	0.0	0.28434298620634024
3642	Against a dark background a young woman gazes at the viewer, dressed in a pink dress with slashed sleeves, after the fashion of the time. It is open at the front to shows a modest white undershirt called a guimp, held together at the neck with a ribbon in the same color of the dress. On her head she is wearing a donut-shaped turban called a balzo with gold embroidery, after a fashion then popular in Italy of the 1530s that is similar to his Turkish Slave, or Titian's Portrait of Isabella d'Este created between 1534 and 1536.	The image features a woman wearing a pink and gold dress, a pink hat, and a pink veil. She is looking directly at the camera, with a confident and elegant expression. The woman's outfit and accessories give her a regal and sophisticated appearance.	0.16417910447761194	0.3548387096774194	0.22448979159308627	0.043478260869565216	0.1	0.06060605638200213	0.14925373134328357	0.3225806451612903	0.20408162832778018	0.8284721374511719	0.7293760776519775	0.7757723331451416	0.0	0.14807502467917077
3652	He chose to be depicted nude as the "God of the Sea".Although Doria is depicted naked, he is not fragile or frail. He is depicted as a powerful virile man, showing masculine spirit, strength, vigor, and power. His beard is lengthy, flowing like the waves on the sea, and tufts of hair on his head recall the Roman emperors. Although his body is aged, his skin is still supple. He originally held a squared oar, a symbol of his command over his own fleet, but a trident head – described by art critic Camille Paglia as "cartoonish" – was painted over it by an unknown artist. The outline of the original oar is still faintly visible. Doria is holding a piece of sailcloth which barely covers his genitals and exposes some of his pubic hair. Paglia asserts that his taut, yet somewhat portly, stomach appears to direct its strength into Doria's covered penis. Jonathan Jones of The Guardian describes the painting as "consciously equat[ing] naval and sexual prowess".Doria stands on the deck of his ship, as Neptune would upon his chariot. He stands in a strained manner, his head facing to the right but his thighs and buttocks remaining in profile.	The image features a man with a beard and a mustache, wearing a loincloth and holding a trident. He appears to be a naked statue, possibly depicting a Greek or Roman figure. The man is standing in front of a flag, which adds a sense of depth and context to the scene.	0.12781954887218044	0.4473684210526316	0.19883040589993506	0.02577319587628866	0.09803921568627451	0.0408163232339861	0.12030075187969924	0.42105263157894735	0.18713449946718652	0.8151523470878601	0.7295832633972168	0.769997775554657	0.0	0.09970276287658783
3663	Influenced by the Laocoon (as is Corregio's treatment of Saint Roch in his San Sebastiano Madonna and Four Saints), the central male figure is sometimes identified as a personification of Vice but sometimes as Silenus (possibly from Virgil's Eclogues 6, where a sleeping Silenus is tied up by the shepherds Chromi and Marsillo and forced to sing by them and the nymph Egle) or Vulcan.	The image depicts a group of naked people gathered around a tree. One man is sitting on the ground, while another man is standing nearby. A woman is also present in the scene, standing close to the man sitting on the ground. The group appears to be enjoying each other's company and the natural surroundings.	0.14	0.175	0.15555555061728413	0.015873015873015872	0.0196078431372549	0.01754385470452586	0.14	0.175	0.15555555061728413	0.7366905212402344	0.680388867855072	0.7074211835861206	0.0	0.13617437925396403
3667	As usually interpreted, the central woman is Minerva, holding a read lance and a plumed helmet - the work may even be a continuation of Mantegna's Triumph of the Virtues, painted for the same studiolo and also featuring a Minerva with a red lance. Glory hovers above her holding a crown, whilst a seated female figure to the right is surrounded by symbols of the four cardinal virtues (a snake in her hair for Prudence, a sword for Justice, reins for temperance and Hercules's lion skin for Fortitude). Some interpret the seated black female figure on the right as Astrology, Science or Intellectual Virtue - she points outside the painting's space and thus (like the putto in Vice) draws the viewer's attention from one painting to the other.	The image depicts a group of people, including a woman, sitting and standing around each other. They are all dressed in fancy clothes, with some of them holding wine glasses. The scene appears to be a social gathering or a celebration.  In the background, there are two angels, one on the left side and the other on the right side of the image. They are both holding swords, adding a sense of drama and elegance to the scene. The presence of the angels and the fancy attire of the people suggest that this could be a religious or historical event.	0.15555555555555556	0.21875	0.1818181769607018	0.04918032786885246	0.06451612903225806	0.05581394857934062	0.13333333333333333	0.1875	0.15584415098667584	0.775048017501831	0.7367821931838989	0.7554308176040649	0.0	0.18583450210378682
3680	The bottom half of the painting is crowded with figures, all symbolically arranged to the left and the right of Christ. On the right is the Virgin Mary, who is held by John the Evangelist, and Mary Magdalene is holding onto the Cross. There is a sharp contrast to those on the right, which includes Roman soldiers who are avoiding his gaze and the Impenitent thief, depicted as bald and bloated. Behind them are contemporary figures, who are considered unenlightened, as they have not yet borne witness to Christ.	The image depicts a large crowd of people gathered around a cross, with some of them dressed in medieval clothing. The people are standing in various positions around the cross, with some closer to the front and others further back. The scene appears to be a religious gathering or a reenactment of a historical event.  In the background, there are two horses, one on the left side and the other on the right side of the image. The horses seem to be part of the medieval-themed event, adding to the authenticity of the scene.	0.19047619047619047	0.21052631578947367	0.19999999501250013	0.07058823529411765	0.06976744186046512	0.07017543359666259	0.1746031746031746	0.19298245614035087	0.18333332834583346	0.7878696918487549	0.7787971496582031	0.7833071351051331	0.0	0.2087835377752632
3686	The subject can be identified as Lukas Spielhausen from the black-and-yellow striped dress of a member of the electoral court of Saxony and the initials JS on his signet ring.	The image features a man wearing a black coat and a gold ring on his finger. He is standing in front of a blue background, possibly in a painting or drawing. The man appears to be a prominent figure in the scene, possibly a portrait or a historical figure.	0.34615384615384615	0.2571428571428571	0.2950819623219565	0.06896551724137931	0.041666666666666664	0.0519480472524882	0.3076923076923077	0.22857142857142856	0.26229507707605487	0.7607529759407043	0.7306839227676392	0.7454153299331665	0.0	0.20623929714838804
3707	The Portrait of Charles V with a Dog is a portrait of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor with a hunting dog, painted by Titian in 1533.	A man dressed in medieval armor is standing next to a dog. The man is holding a knife in his hand, and the dog appears to be sniffing his crotch. The scene is quite unusual and humorous, as it is not common to see a knight interacting with a dog in such a manner.	0.23809523809523808	0.13513513513513514	0.1724137884839478	0.043478260869565216	0.019230769230769232	0.026666662414222903	0.23809523809523808	0.13513513513513514	0.1724137884839478	0.7043017148971558	0.7014083862304688	0.7028520703315735	0.0	0.18749999999999997
3712	This painting shows the artist in the role of Grand tourist with the Colosseum in the background.	The image features a man with a beard and a mustache, wearing a black robe and a chain. He is standing in front of a large building, possibly a castle or a church. The man appears to be looking at the viewer, possibly posing for a portrait. The building in the background is quite large and has a prominent presence in the scene.	0.38461538461538464	0.11904761904761904	0.1818181782082645	0.13333333333333333	0.03333333333333333	0.05333333013333353	0.3076923076923077	0.09523809523809523	0.1454545418446282	0.7502013444900513	0.7993922233581543	0.7740159630775452	0.0	0.27392241379310345
3716	The title of "Turkish Slave" derives from the misinterpretation of the sitter's headwear as a turban. She is wearing a chemise under her elaborately sleeved dress called a guimp and is holding a feather fan used as a flywhisk. The subject is a young woman with brown hair and eyes, portrayed as a half-figure. She wears a white silk dress or bodice striped with gold. Her over-dress of indigo  blue satin has large puffed sleeves and is worn low around the shoulders, revealing the bodice. She also wears a soft embroidered apron on her belly of a type also represented in the painting Antea by the same artist. On the head she wears a doughnut-shaped headdress sewn with gilt thread and decorated by a medallion portraying Pegasus, perhaps a metaphor of love or a heraldic reference to the Cavalli family. On the hand, whose slender fingers are typical of Parmigianino art, she wears a small ring, perhaps a reference to a recent marriage. She holds a plume used to fan herself, depicted with highly detailed brushstrokes.	A woman wearing a yellow and white dress is holding a white and brown stuffed animal. She is smiling and appears to be the main focus of the image.	0.11403508771929824	0.5652173913043478	0.18978101910384143	0.03636363636363636	0.21428571428571427	0.062176163322505404	0.10526315789473684	0.5217391304347826	0.17518247895785607	0.8349447250366211	0.7274669408798218	0.7775091528892517	0.0	0.06679566190044516
3726	The Uffizi painting shows saint Jerome and saint Anne to either side of a Holy Family.	The image depicts a group of people, including a woman and a baby, sitting together.

3729	It depicts a gondolier returning the ring of Saint Mark to the Doge Bartolomeo Gradenigo. Respectfully kneeling before him, he related the story of the battle between the devils and the patron saints of Venice.	The image depicts a lively scene in a large building, possibly a church or a palace. A group of people, including a man in a purple robe, are gathered around a man kneeling on the ground. The man in the purple robe appears to be kneeling in front of the man on the ground.  There are several other people in the scene, some standing and others sitting. A few individuals are wearing ties, adding to the formal atmosphere of the gathering. The building features a large archway, which adds to the grandeur of the setting.  In the background, there is a chair and a bench, suggesting that the gathering might be taking place in a seating area or a designated meeting space.	0.25	0.0945945945945946	0.137254897977701	0.08823529411764706	0.027777777777777776	0.04225351748462638	0.21428571428571427	0.08108108108108109	0.11764705484044613	0.7185988426208496	0.7184756994247437	0.7185372710227966	0.0	0.19832985386221297

The atmosphere appears to be lively and engaging, as the woman's gesture captures the interest of the onlookers.	0.35	0.1320754716981132	0.191780817939576	0.041666666666666664	0.014285714285714285	0.021276591942055906	0.3	0.11320754716981132	0.1643835576656034	0.6735485792160034	0.6938668489456177	0.6835567355155945	0.0	0.20833333333333334
3764	It depicts a nude young woman, traditionally identified with the goddess Venus, reclining on a couch or bed in the sumptuous surroundings of a Renaissance palace. In this depiction, Titian has domesticated Venus by moving her to an indoor setting, engaging her with the viewer, and making her sensuality explicit. For Charles Hope, "It has yet to be shown that the most famous example of this genre, Titian's Venus of Urbino, is anything other than a representation of a beautiful nude woman on a bed, devoid of classical or even allegorical content." The Venus stares straight at the viewer, unconcerned with her nudity. In her right hand she holds a posy of roses whilst she holds her other hand over her genitals. In the near background is a dog, often a symbol of fidelity. In a different space in the background two maids are shown rummaging through a cassone chest, where clothes were kept.	The image features a beautiful woman lying on a bed, wearing a gown. She is surrounded by a few potted plants, with one placed near her head and another on the right side of the bed. The woman appears to be relaxing or resting in the room.	0.19047619047619047	0.5128205128205128	0.277777773828125	0.033783783783783786	0.10869565217391304	0.051546388134764844	0.1619047619047619	0.4358974358974359	0.2361111071614584	0.8106318712234497	0.7335849404335022	0.7701862454414368	0.0	0.13044474131172074
3767	It shows the Madonna and Child on a high throne, with two angels holding the crown (a 15th-century Flemish painting element also in use in Italy). In the lower part are four saints: Stephen, John the Evangelist, Simon the Zealot and Lawrence. Simon is holding the halberd which gives its name to the altarpiece. At the sides of the throne, between columns and draperies, are two sections of sky with clouds.	The image depicts a religious scene with a group of men gathered around a painting of Mary and the baby Jesus. The men are dressed in red and orange robes, and they appear to be praying or admiring the painting. The painting is prominently displayed in the center of the scene, and the men are positioned around it, with some standing closer to the painting and others further away. The overall atmosphere of the image suggests a sense of reverence and devotion to the religious subject matter.	0.18867924528301888	0.19230769230769232	0.19047618547664413	0.028985507246376812	0.024691358024691357	0.02666666169866759	0.16981132075471697	0.17307692307692307	0.17142856642902507	0.7843928337097168	0.7594318985939026	0.7717105746269226	0.0	0.21945677620562112
3769	The figure of Christ is in the top left corner of the fresco. He is making a dramatic entrance into the scene, surrounded by a halo of light and a security detail of heavenly hosts. Some of these angels look on in awe and shock at the event occurring, while others act as a protective barrier between those things which are heavenly and divine and those which are earthly and below. From Christ, a beam of light radiates down to a group of figures. This group is highly dramatized in their posing and expression. Surrounding Saul is a triangular composition of companions that attempt to aid him as he lies recumbent on the ground. With one hand raised to shield himself from Christ, he has an expression of strange discomfort and fear. The downward sloping hills, the beam of radiant light, and the groupings of the figures surrounding Saul make it clear to the viewer that he is the most important person in this figure-heavy piece. Further in the background is an outline of a city to contextualize the exact moment in which Saul is experiencing this divine intervention. The people on earth range from fearful to concerned. Even the angels above seem to be shaken by the actions of Christ. As he does in most of his pieces, Michelangelo pays careful attention to anatomy and gives great detail to the musculature and form of all of the figures whether clothed or nude. Even the horse is shown to have some muscularity as he recedes into the background, carrying a stray figure with him. The muscles and anatomy seem contorted and elongated in ways that should not be natural and the figures are in impractical poses.	The image depicts a lively scene of people gathered in a field, with some of them kneeling and others standing. There are numerous individuals in the scene, with some of them appearing to be engaged in a religious ceremony. A horse is also present in the field, adding to the dynamic atmosphere of the gathering. The overall setting suggests a sense of community and shared experience among the people present.	0.0975609756097561	0.3404255319148936	0.1516587643098763	0.022222222222222223	0.09375	0.03592814061457949	0.08536585365853659	0.2978723404255319	0.13270141833831234	0.810488760471344	0.7395009994506836	0.773369312286377	0.0	0.09906847797472797
3772	The Crossing of the Red Sea, also known as The Crossing of the Red Sea and Moses Appointing Joshua, is a fresco painting by the Italian artist Agnolo di Cosimo, known as Bronzino, finished in 1542.	The image depicts a large fresco painting of a group of people gathered around a body of water.

3778	This portrayal of the Deposition, although it depicts all the characters typically shown when Jesus is being taken down from the cross, more correctly should be characterized as a Lamentation and is an excellent example of late Mannerism or Maniera.	The image depicts a painting of Jesus being held by a woman, surrounded by a group of people. The woman is holding Jesus' body, while the people in the painting are gathered around them, showing their support and love for Jesus.

3795	Bronzino shows the child half-length and sitting on a chair, recalling the pose in his slightly earlier Portrait of Lucrezia Panciatichi - a rigid official pose offset by some hints of hand movement, as if the character was about to get up, along with an intense but emotionless gaze straight at the viewer. The face is lit and highlighted by the blue background, whilst the cold light and absence of any strong chiaroscuro effect accentuates the smoothness of the subject's complexion and idealises her features. Her complexion is a pale white because Bronzino painted the portrait using her death mask as a model. Bia has her hair parted in the middle of her forehead and a falling bob, with two carefully tied braids framing the face. She wears pearl earrings, a gold chain with a pendant or medallion with her father's profile on it, emphasizing her bond with her father. She also wears a sumptuous dress, made of blue satin with puffy sleeves, produced in the silk factories Cosimo was setting up in Florence at the time. With her right hand she is fiddling with the end or tassel of a golden chain or belt around her waist.	A young girl wearing a white dress and a pearl necklace is sitting on a chair. She is looking at the camera, and her expression is one of curiosity.

The image is a painting of a man with a beard and mustache, wearing a black robe. He is holding his hands in front of his chest, possibly in a gesture of prayer or contemplation.

3830	The costume of the kneeling Catherine of Alexandria in the centre probably means the artist tried to paint the Doge Francesco Donato in the centre of the canvas to fit in with the terms of his commission, but replaced his face with that of the saint when that attempt failed. Between her and the Madonna is Augustine of Hippo, whilst behind Catherine are Mark the Evangelist (standing) and John the Baptist (seated with the Lamb of God).	The image depicts a group of people, including a woman and a child, dressed in medieval clothing. They are standing in front of a painting, which appears to be a religious scene. The woman is holding a drum, and the child is standing next to her.

3866	It depicts the scabrous relationship between Pope Paul III and his grandsons, Ottavio and Alessandro Farnese. Ottavio is shown in the act of kneeling, to his left; Alessandro, wearing a cardinal's dress, stands behind him to his right. Although unfinished and less technically accomplished than his Portrait of Pope Paul III of a few years earlier, it is renowned for its rich colouring; the deep reds of the tablecloth and the almost spectral whites of Paul's gown. The panel contains subtle indications of the contradictions in the character of the Pope, and captures the complex psychological dynamic between the three men. The deep red background and heavy brushstrokes establish an anxious and tense atmosphere, and the uneasy relationship between the Pope and his suitors. His hat or camauro cloaks his baldness, but there are tell-tale signs of age in his long nose, dark beady eyes, stooped shoulders and long uneven beard. This fact is reinforced by the clock placed on the table beside him, which serves both as a memento mori and a reminder that time is running out. He is dressed in full pomp, wearing wide fur-lined sleeves (a typical Venetian device to convey status), and his cape is laid across his upper body to suggest physical presence. The lower two-thirds are dominated by heavy red and white pigments; browns and whites are prominent in the upper right-hand section. This division is delineated by a diagonal reaching from the upper edge of the curtain down to Ottavio's leggings in the right mid-ground. Other echoes of the colours and patterns include the red of Paul's robes against the velvet of his chair and the overhanging curtain. Ottavio, shown as tall and muscular, is about to kneel to kiss the Pope's feet, a contemporary manner of greeting a pope: a guest would make three short bows followed by the kissing of the papal feet. Ottavio's head is bowed, but his stern facial expression conveys that he is acting as protocol dictates, rather than with genuine diffidence. Ottavio, by contrast, wears the browns of the upper right-hand passage, an area of the painting that cuts him physically from the pope. His pose is awkward and difficult to interpret, but he is rendered in a more naturalistic manner than his brother. Thus Alessandro seems better placed politically, standing to Paul's right in a pose that recalls traditional depictions of Paul the Apostle, and his hand is raised as if in blessing.	The painting depicts a scene where a man in a red robe is talking to another man who is wearing a white robe. The man in the red robe is pointing at the man in the white robe, who is sitting down. The man in the white robe is wearing a hat, and there is a cup placed nearby. The painting is set in a room with a dining table and a chair.	0.07563025210084033	0.5142857142857142	0.13186812963276043	0.013227513227513227	0.08928571428571429	0.023041472406719412	0.058823529411764705	0.4	0.10256410032873114	0.7964260578155518	0.6806722283363342	0.734013557434082	0.0	0.07213812677388837

3891	The scene shows, in the upper part, the saint intervening to make invulnerable a slave about to be martyred for his veneration of another saint's relics. All the figures are inscribed into an architectonic scenario.	The image depicts a lively scene of a man being crucified, surrounded by a crowd of people. The man is hanging from a cross, and the crowd is gathered around him, watching the event unfold. There are several people in the scene, with some standing closer to the cross and others further away.  In the background, there is a building that adds to the atmosphere of the scene. The overall setting appears to be a public event or gathering, with the crucifixion being the main attraction.	0.28125	0.15789473684210525	0.20224718640575695	0.058823529411764705	0.023809523809523808	0.033898300982476794	0.28125	0.15789473684210525	0.20224718640575695	0.7543761134147644	0.7723578810691833	0.763261079788208	0.0	0.26685537984082625
3892	It shows Charles V seated on a chair to the left, facing the viewer, with his black robes contrasted with the red carpet and gold tapestry behind him. In the right half of the painting is a landscape, barely sketched in, in light colours.	The image is a painting of a man wearing a black hat and a long black coat, sitting on a chair. He is holding a book in his hand and appears to be looking at the viewer. The painting is set in a room with a couch and a dining table visible in the background. The man is the main focus of the painting, and his attire and posture suggest a sense of authority or importance.	0.34210526315789475	0.2765957446808511	0.3058823479972319	0.11627906976744186	0.06756756756756757	0.08547008082109747	0.2631578947368421	0.2127659574468085	0.23529411270311426	0.8182786703109741	0.8193695545196533	0.8188237547874451	0.0	0.3060764050042803
3893	The portrait follows a classic scheme already used by Raphael and Leonardo da Vinci, in which the model sits next to a window opening on a landscape. The landscape gives depth to the composition, and its greenish and bluish tones provide a contrast to the interior scene dominated by warm colors. The figure shows some stiffness, possibly related to the concept of majesty as used in imperial iconography. She wears a rich red dress and gold brocade and trimmed with rhinestones. It is decorated also with flashy jewelry: a necklace of pearls with a clasp at the chest with gems hanging from another teardrop pearl, a ring on her right hand, and a jewel-topped headdress. Her rigid hairstyle, very fashionable at the time, is made up with braids. The Empress holds an open book in her left hand, perhaps a missal or prayer book, and looks at a distant point with preoccupied expression.	The image features a woman dressed in a fancy gown, sitting in a chair and holding a book. She is wearing a necklace and appears to be looking at the book. The scene is set in a room with a window in the background. The woman's attire and the presence of the book suggest that she might be a noblewoman or a scholar.	0.14678899082568808	0.3902439024390244	0.21333332936088895	0.026845637583892617	0.06779661016949153	0.038461534397652056	0.12844036697247707	0.34146341463414637	0.1866666626942223	0.8065536618232727	0.7413678169250488	0.7725881934165955	0.0	0.15614954004469184
3895	Her aged 20".Hemessen is shown at half length and holding a brush, looking outwards as if at her own image as she records it on the oak panel in front of her. She has only begun work on the depicted painting, no background has been put down, and only a sketch of her head can be seen. Her face is painted with soft brush-strokes, while the textures of her gown are distinguished using a wider variety of brushmarks. In the main image, Hemessen has shown herself elegantly clothed in a black brocade dress and red velvet sleeves. Her arms are outsized in proportion to the rest of her body. There are a number of deliberate contradictions and explorations of mirror images at play. Hemessen holds the brush with her right hand; she would have corrected the reversal on the reflected image. Her head as shown on the panel is undersized and situated on the top left; that is opposite to the position her head appears on the actual painting. Her head is turned in the direction of the viewer but her eyes do not meet the viewer's. Typical of her work, the background is plain and dark, and gives no indication of the space occupied by the sitter.	The image features a woman wearing a black dress, painting a picture. She is holding a brush in her hand, focused on her artwork. The woman appears to be the main subject of the painting, and her attire suggests a historical or traditional setting. The painting itself is displayed in the background, showcasing the artist's work.	0.16	0.4878048780487805	0.2409638517019887	0.02564102564102564	0.09090909090909091	0.039999996568000296	0.136	0.4146341463414634	0.2048192733887357	0.8382691740989685	0.7610492706298828	0.7977949976921082	0.0	0.11241217798594846
3899	It shows the punishment of the giant Tityos from Greek mythology.	The image depicts a man lying on the ground, chained to a rock. A bird, possibly a vulture, is perched on his back, adding a sense of danger and struggle to the scene. The man's position and the presence of the bird create a powerful and intense atmosphere.	0.2	0.05714285714285714	0.08888888543209889	0.1	0.02127659574468085	0.035087716405047945	0.2	0.05714285714285714	0.08888888543209889	0.7273409366607666	0.7434771060943604	0.735320508480072	0.0	0.22682926829268293
3901	The icon shows Ivan the Terrible as he follows the Archangel Michael in leading the triumphant Russian troops away from the conquered city in flames (symbolising both Kazan' and Sodom). In the top left corner of the icon the Mother of God with the infant Jesus is shown seated outside the heavenly gate of Jerusalem (symbolising the city of Moscow) and distributing crowns to messenger angels who proceed to reward the martyrs of Ivan's army.	The image depicts a painting of a man riding a horse, surrounded by a large group of people. The man on the horse is likely a king, as he is wearing a crown. The people surrounding him are dressed in various styles, some wearing armor, and others dressed in more casual attire. The scene appears to be a historical or mythological representation, with the man on the horse possibly leading his army.	0.21818181818181817	0.23529411764705882	0.2264150893467427	0.02702702702702703	0.029850746268656716	0.02836878933856533	0.2	0.21568627450980393	0.20754716481844088	0.7453114986419678	0.7293902635574341	0.7372649908065796	0.0	0.18437681159420288
3905	Landscape with the Fall of Icarus is a painting in oil on canvas measuring 73.5 by 112 centimetres (28.9 in × 44.1 in) in the Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium in Brussel. His legs can be seen in the water just below the ship. The sun, already half-set on the horizon, is a long way away; the flight did not reach anywhere near it. The shepherd gazing into the air, away from the ship, may be explained by another version of the composition (see below); in the original work there was probably also a figure of Daedalus in the sky to the left, at which he stares. However, paintings from the same period by the Antwerp artist Pieter Aertsen had large kitchen or market genre scenes, with large figures in the foreground, and in the distant background a glimpse of a scene from the Life of Christ.	The painting depicts a lively scene of people and animals near the water. There are several people scattered throughout the image, with some standing closer to the water and others further away. A man is pulling a cart with a wheelbarrow, while another man is walking with a sheep.  In the background, there are multiple boats of varying sizes, some of which are closer to the shore and others further out in the water. The presence of the boats and the people interacting with them creates a sense of activity and movement in the scene.	0.1574074074074074	0.3090909090909091	0.20858895258383842	0.027972027972027972	0.047058823529411764	0.035087714621807334	0.1388888888888889	0.2727272727272727	0.18404907528322492	0.7898356318473816	0.7174868583679199	0.7519249320030212	0.0	0.1787505858574023
3909	The paintings took subjects from the Roman poet Ovid's Metamorphoses, in this case Book IV, lines 663–752, and all featured female nudes. The painting shows the hero Perseus flying through the air in combat to kill the sea monster who has come to kill Andromeda, who has been chained to a cliff by the sea shore for him. Perseus has already attacked and wounded the monster on the shoulder.	The image depicts a painting of a woman standing on a rock in the ocean, with a chain around her neck. She is surrounded by a serene environment, with a boat visible in the background. The woman appears to be in a precarious position, as she is being lifted off the rock by a man who is flying through the air. The scene is full of action and intrigue, capturing the viewer's attention.	0.2549019607843137	0.26	0.2574257375747476	0.046153846153846156	0.043478260869565216	0.044776114407440976	0.21568627450980393	0.22	0.2178217771787081	0.7839624881744385	0.7363523244857788	0.7594119310379028	0.0	0.21873720251082537

3953	The painting is very large, and the figures somewhat disconnected, the composition divided into two by the tree at centre. In the right foreground we have a scene that would have been familiar to well-educated Renaissance viewers as Jupiter, having taken the form of a satyr, creeping up on the sleeping nymph Antiope, and lifting her drapery to view her naked. The painting can be compared to his The Bacchanal of the Andrians of 1523-24 (Prado), where an apparently unconscious nude in a version of the Dresden Venus pose shares the picture space with a group of revellers in a mixture of nudity, contemporary and classical dress. Venus or Antiope sleeps as yet undisturbed, not only by the voyeur, but a hunting scene above her, where hounds have brought down a stag, and immediately left of her, a satyr or faun with the legs of a goat seated on the ground, in conversation with a lady in contemporary dress. Immediately beside them stands a hunter, with large dogs, and at far left another huntsman blows a horn. Over Venus' head, Cupid perches in a tree, with an arrow in his bow, apparently pointed at Jupiter. In the middle distance a naked couple, apparently both women, talk or kiss on the banks of a river. The river has a wide waterfall above the stag, and presumably then flows above the conversing couple before perhaps circling round behind the viewer to create the water behind the Jupiter/satyr, but this is not shown clearly, which is rather typical of Titian. To the right, the landscape includes a contemporary farmhouse at the top of the rise, and a distant settlement dominated by a church tower and steeple. Distant mountains complete the view, which like many Titian landscapes reflects the country between Venice and his hometown of Pieve di Cadore in the mountains, though he does not seem to have closely depicted specific locations.	The image depicts a lush, green forest scene with a group of people, including a naked woman, relaxing and enjoying the outdoors. There are several individuals scattered throughout the scene, some of them sitting or lying down, while others are standing.  In the midst of the forest, there is a tree with a bow and arrow hanging from it, adding a playful element to the scene. The overall atmosphere of the painting is one of leisure and relaxation, with the people taking advantage of the natural beauty around them.	0.08585858585858586	0.2698412698412698	0.13026819557140978	0.026402640264026403	0.09411764705882353	0.041237109980471115	0.08585858585858586	0.2698412698412698	0.13026819557140978	0.8011664152145386	0.7248516082763672	0.7611007690429688	0.004696929245415213	0.09753901560624248

4019	This painting depicts a common festival of the period, as celebrated in the Southern Netherlands. It presents the contrast between two sides of contemporary life, as can be seen by the appearance of the inn on the left side—for enjoyment, and the church on the right side—for religious observance.

4133	Netherlandish Proverbs (Dutch: Nederlandse Spreekwoorden; also called Flemish Proverbs, The Blue Cloak or The Topsy Turvy World) is a 1559 oil-on-oak-panel painting by Pieter Bruegel the Elder that depicts a scene in which humans and, to a lesser extent, animals and objects, offer literal illustrations of Dutch language proverbs and idioms. Many of the people depicted show the characteristic blank features that Bruegel used to portray fools.	The image depicts a lively scene of people gathered around a large building, possibly a castle or a church. There are numerous individuals of various ages and genders, all engaged in different activities. Some people are standing, while others are sitting or lying down.

4147	It is one of the first paintings in western art to feature a significant snow landscape and was painted in the aftermath of the winter of 1565, which was one of the harshest winters on record. The painting shows a Flemish village in winter at sundown. A group of people is gathered at a building on the left. A sign bearing the Habsburg double-headed eagle is visible on the building. Other people are making their way to the same building, including the figures of Joseph and the pregnant Virgin Mary on a donkey. A pig is being slaughtered. People are going about their daily business in the cold, children are shown playing with toys on the ice and having snowball fights. At the very centre of the painting is a spoked wheel, sometimes interpreted as being a reference to the wheel of fortune. To the right, a man in a small hut is shown holding a clapper, a warning to keep away from leprosy. There is a begging bowl in front of the hut. The ruined castle in the backgroundsee 2nd detail is based on the towers and gates of Amsterdam.	The image depicts a snowy village scene with a large group of people gathered around. Some of the people are standing close to each other, while others are spread out throughout the scene. The village is bustling with activity, as there are numerous horses and carts scattered throughout the area.  In addition to the people and animals, there are several birds visible in the scene, adding to the lively atmosphere. The overall setting appears to be a winter festival or gathering, with people enjoying the snowy weather and participating in various activities.	0.14912280701754385	0.27419354838709675	0.1931818136182852	0.033707865168539325	0.06896551724137931	0.0452830144575298	0.14912280701754385	0.27419354838709675	0.1931818136182852	0.806510865688324	0.7491909265518188	0.776794970035553	0.0	0.1469098277608916
4148	The painting depicts a virago, Dulle Griet, who leads an army of women to pillage Hell, and is currently held and exhibited at the Museum Mayer van den Bergh in Antwerp.	The image depicts a woman in a medieval scene, surrounded by a crowd of people. She is holding a large bag, possibly filled with food or other items.

4155	The painting shows Venetians busy removing corpses from tombs along the right wall and from a crypt in the background. In the left foreground, the standing luminous saint himself with a faint halo appears and beseeches them to stop, because his body has been found and lies pale at his feet, strewn on an oriental rug. In the center of the canvas, an elder (portrait of Rangone) kneels acknowledging the miracle. Elsewhere in the room, the figures are either astonished or oblivious to the apparition. In places, the work appears unfinished: the tiles of floor and cornices is visible through some clothing and figures. The foreshortening is accentuated by the tiles, and the wall tombs, and finally by rays of light seeming to emerge from the crypt in the background. In the foreground at the right, a contorted half-naked man is described as "possessed by demons", above him hover strands of smoke.	The image depicts a lively scene in a large building, possibly a church or a museum. A group of people, including a man and a woman, are gathered in the room, with some of them standing and others sitting. The people are engaged in various activities, such as talking, playing, or simply observing the surroundings.  In the room, there are several chairs and a bench, providing seating options for the people present. A dog can also be seen in the scene, adding to the lively atmosphere.

4159	In medieval times, Cockaigne was a mythical land of plenty, but Bruegel's depiction of Cockaigne and its residents is not meant to be a flattering one. He chooses rather a comic illustration of the spiritual emptiness believed to derive from gluttony and sloth, two of the seven deadly sins. In the painting, a clerk, a peasant, and a soldier lie dozing on the ground underneath a table bound to a tree. The clerk's book, papers, ink and pen lie idle, as do the peasant's flail and the soldier's lance and gauntlet. A half-eaten egg in its shell runs between the peasant and the clerk. The table attached to the tree is laden with partly consumed food and drink. Behind the tree, a roasted fowl lays itself upon a silver platter, implying that it is ready to be eaten, and a roasted pig runs about with a carving knife already slipped under its skin. On the left, a knight emerges from a lean-to whose roof is covered in dishes of pie and pastry, with an open mouth, waiting for a roasted pigeon to fly in (the pigeon was accidentally removed during restoration work). On the right and behind the main action, a man clutching a spoon forces his way out of a large cloud of pudding, having eaten his way through it; he reaches for the bent branch of a tree in order to lower himself into Cockaigne. The fence enclosing the main scene behind the dozing trio is made of interwoven sausages. A partly eaten wheel of cheese and a bush (or tower) of loaves of bread are on the left and right of the scene, respectively.	The image depicts a group of people lying on the ground, possibly enjoying a picnic or a relaxing day outdoors. There are several people in the scene, with some lying on the ground and others sitting or standing.  The setting includes a dining table with various items on it, such as bowls, cups, and a knife. There are also a couple of books and a bird present in the scene, adding to the overall atmosphere. The people in the image are spread out, with some closer to the foreground and others further back, creating a sense of depth and engagement with the viewer.	0.0872093023255814	0.24193548387096775	0.1282051243100301	0.019157088122605363	0.054945054945054944	0.028409087075316895	0.0872093023255814	0.24193548387096775	0.1282051243100301	0.7839130163192749	0.7143661975860596	0.7475255131721497	0.0	0.13357695299575942
4160	Christ is depicted as a playful baby, slightly off balance as He tips forward with arms outstretched towards Catherine, who in turn leans gently towards Him.	The image depicts a family scene with a woman holding a baby. The woman is accompanied by two other people, one on her left and the other on her right. The woman on the left is holding a child, while the woman on the right is holding a book. The family appears to be gathered around, possibly for a special occasion or a family gathering.	0.125	0.08108108108108109	0.09836065096479464	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.125	0.08108108108108109	0.09836065096479464	0.7308488488197327	0.7567510604858398	0.7435745000839233	0.0	0.12012012012012013
4162	The painting shows a world landscape, with the foreground a woodland clearing containing three peasants dancing to a bagpipes, next to a gallows upon which a magpie is perched. The gallows stands in the centre of the picture, dividing the painting in two, a Mannerist composition with the right side more "open" and left more "closed", with the magpie close to the exact centre of the painting. The gallows appears to form an "impossible object", similar to a Penrose triangle, with the bases of the posts seemingly planted side by side, but with the right side of the cross-member receding into the distance, and contradictory lighting. Another magpie sits on a rock at the base of the gallows, near the skull of an animal. The only people occupy the left foreground: a man defecates in the shadows to the left, while others watch the three dancers. To the right stands a cross with a watermill behind. The background opens on to a view of a river valley, with a town to the left and castle on a rocky crag above, and a tower on a rock outcrop to the right, and distant hills and the sky beyond. Behind the dancers rise two intertwined trees, a motif used by Bruegel in an earlier drawing of bears playing in a forest. An impression of depth is given by the progression from dense brown tones dominating of the foreground, through green midtones in the middle distance, to light blues and greys for the background.	The image depicts a group of people gathered in a valley, with a large cross prominently displayed in the foreground. The people are standing around the cross, possibly participating in a religious ceremony or event. The valley is surrounded by mountains, creating a picturesque and serene setting for the gathering.	0.10144927536231885	0.358974358974359	0.158192086959686	0.02702702702702703	0.125	0.04444444152098785	0.09420289855072464	0.3333333333333333	0.1468926519314374	0.8049218654632568	0.7330188751220703	0.7672895193099976	0.0	0.07065970474308092
4164	The work translates the Biblical account of the Massacre of the Innocents into a winter scene in the Netherlands in the prelude to the Dutch Revolt against Spanish rule, also known as the Eighty Years' War. Working from the church in the background towards the foreground: a mounted soldier with a lance guards a bridge. To the left, a man tries to hide a child. Moving forward and further towards the left, one soldier urinates against a wall; and further left, another soldier guides some women into a house, and a third soldier drags an infant out of another house (one of few infants remaining alive in the painting, and one of few not overpainted in the version in the Royal Collection). A group of four villagers mourns nearby. Moving right, towards the centre of the painting, a lone woman stands grieving over her dead baby lying with blood spilled on the snow (overpainted in the version in the Royal Collection with meats and cheeses), and a couple ask a soldier to take their daughter not their baby son (overpainted in the version in the Royal Collection as a large bird). A crowd of villagers surround and confront a red-coated soldier standing over a dead baby (overpainted as a bundle), and a seated woman grieves with her dead baby on her lap (changed to a bundle). Continuing to the right, at the centre of the painting, a group of Spanish soldiers in black armour stab with spears at a group of babies (changed to animals) in front of a large group of mounted soldiers also with lances and wearing black armour. One of the mounted soldiers may be holding a standard of five gold crosses on a white ground, the heraldic arms of Jerusalem. A soldier with striped breeches stabs one child (overpainted as a boar) and another stabs at a baby held by a woman (overpainted as a jug). Further to the right, a single mounted man is surrounded by a group of protesting villagers: originally he was a herald wearing a tabard decorated with a Habsburg double-headed eagle. At the far right, two mounted soldiers wear red jackets and rounded metal helmets. Some soldiers on foot are breaking into an inn: the inn sign originally showed a star linking it with the Star of Bethlehem (overpainted in the version in the Royal Collection). One soldier wields an axe and another has a log to use as a battering ram; three are climbing into an open window, and one with a halberd kicks at a door, shaking off an overhanging icicle which threatens to fall on his head. Moving across the foreground, right to left, a baby (changed to a bundle) has been torn from a mother and her small daughter; a soldier holds back a large dog; and further the left, in the immediate foreground, a soldier is about to stab a child (overpainted as a calf). At the far left, another soldier chases after a woman. A group of mounted soldiers stands in the left foreground, two in black armour with lances, a trumpeter in a yellow jacket, and three with red jackets.	The image depicts a snowy village scene with a large group of people gathered in the snow. Some of the people are riding horses, while others are walking or standing in the snow. There are several horses scattered throughout the scene, with some closer to the foreground and others further in the background.  In addition to the people and horses, there are a few birds visible in the sky, adding to the wintery atmosphere. The village appears to be bustling with activity, as people engage in various winter activities.	0.09482758620689655	0.38596491228070173	0.15224913178146818	0.02122641509433962	0.1111111111111111	0.035643561663052846	0.08620689655172414	0.3508771929824561	0.13840830133164123	0.7926086187362671	0.6996445059776306	0.7432308793067932	0.0004747421956961521	0.057471264367816084
4171	The front depicts the Adoration of the Shepherds, a Christian Knight, and the Baptism of Jesus. The back panels show the Annunciation to Mary, Mount Sinai, and Adam and Eve. The back panel shows pilgrims on the way to the Saint Catherine's Monastery in Egypt as if on their way to Heaven.	The image features a large, ornate wooden structure with a painting of Jesus on the cross. The painting is surrounded by various other paintings, depicting a diverse range of scenes and characters. The structure appears to be a church or a religious building, with the artwork showcasing the importance of faith and spirituality.	0.21621621621621623	0.20512820512820512	0.2105263107929364	0.04081632653061224	0.038461538461538464	0.03960395540045157	0.21621621621621623	0.20512820512820512	0.2105263107929364	0.7635283470153809	0.7625516057014465	0.7630397081375122	0.0	0.19916035418062608
4178	The painting depicts  Europa on the back of the bull, just off the shore of her homeland.	The image depicts a beautiful woman lying on a horse, surrounded by a serene landscape. The woman is positioned in the center of the scene, with the horse beneath her. The horse is located towards the right side of the image.  In the background, there are several angels flying through the sky, adding a sense of wonder and spirituality to the scene. The angels are scattered throughout the image, with some closer to the top left corner, others in the middle, and a few more towards the right side. The combination of the woman, horse, and angels creates a captivating and enchanting atmosphere.	0.42857142857142855	0.0967741935483871	0.15789473383656513	0.0625	0.010526315789473684	0.018018015550686158	0.42857142857142855	0.0967741935483871	0.15789473383656513	0.7123689651489258	0.7888617515563965	0.7486665844917297	0.0	0.19031141868512114
4183	Titian looks remote, aged and gaunt, staring into the middle distance, seemingly lost in thought. Yet the portrait projects dignity, authority and the mark of a master painter. Titian is dressed in simple but expensive clothes. In the lower left corner of the canvas he holds a paintbrush. The portrait is composed of deep shades of rich and distinguished black and brown, with small touches of white around his face and hair, and on his neckline and chain.	The image features a man wearing a black robe and a white collar, with a long beard. He is looking directly at the viewer, possibly posing for a portrait. The man appears to be a religious figure, possibly a priest or a monk, given his attire and the context of the painting. The painting itself is quite detailed, capturing the man's facial features and the intricate details of his clothing.	0.1896551724137931	0.22916666666666666	0.2075471648558207	0.025974025974025976	0.029411764705882353	0.027586201915815404	0.15517241379310345	0.1875	0.169811315799217	0.8052564859390259	0.7851337194442749	0.7950678467750549	0.0	0.19296254256526674
4184	The colours are darker in the near subjects, while the figures in the background are white, nearly transparent. The strange red sky is roiling with ominous clouds, riven with a thunderbolt, affording the painting a heavy, dynamic atmosphere. Tintoretto himself is portrayed within the work as the bearded man beside the camel.	The image depicts a group of people gathered around a man who is lying on the ground. Some of the people are standing, while others are kneeling or sitting. The man lying on the ground appears to be the center of attention, possibly due to his condition or the situation at hand. The scene takes place in front of a building, which could be a church or another significant structure.	0.2	0.16666666666666666	0.18181817685950424	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.175	0.14583333333333334	0.15909090413223156	0.7522596716880798	0.7530025839805603	0.752630889415741	0.0	0.21780175130560056
4205	In broad terms they have exactly the same composition, but at a detailed level everything is different, whether in the architecture of the tower or in the sky and the landscape around the tower. The paintings depict the construction of the Tower of Babel, which, according to the Book of Genesis in the Bible, was built by a unified, monolingual humanity as a mark of their achievement and to prevent them from scattering: "Then they said, 'Come, let us build ourselves a city, and a tower with its top in the heavens, and let us make a name for ourselves; otherwise we shall be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.'"	The image depicts a large stone structure, possibly a castle or a tower, with a group of people standing in front of it. There are at least nine people visible in the scene, with some standing closer to the structure and others further away. The people appear to be observing the impressive architecture, possibly admiring its grandeur and historical significance.	0.15	0.26666666666666666	0.19199999539200013	0.018867924528301886	0.03389830508474576	0.024242419648118404	0.1375	0.24444444444444444	0.17599999539200015	0.7740188241004944	0.7137192487716675	0.7426469922065735	0.0	0.16028285868534486
4210	The painting shows a panorama of an army of skeletons wreaking havoc across a blackened, desolate landscape. Fires burn in the distance, and the sea is littered with shipwrecks . A few leafless trees stud hills otherwise bare of vegetation; fish lie rotting on the shores of a corpse-choked pond. In the foreground, skeletons haul a wagon full of skulls; in the upper left corner, others ring the bell that signifies the death knell of the world. People are herded into a coffin-shaped trap decorated with crosses, while a skeleton on horseback kills people with a scythe. The painting depicts people of different social backgrounds – from peasants and soldiers to nobles as well as a king and a cardinal – being taken by death indiscriminately. A skeleton parodies human happiness by playing a hurdy-gurdy while the wheels of his cart crush a man like he's nothing. A woman has fallen in the path of the death cart; she has a slender thread which is about to be cut by the scissors in her other hand— Bruegel's interpretation of Atropos. Nearby another woman in the path of the cart, holds in her hand a spindle and distaff, classical symbols of the fragility of human life— another Bruegel interpretation of Clotho and Lachesis; a starving dog nibbles at the face of a dead child she holds. Just beside her, a cardinal is helped towards his fate by a skeleton who mockingly wears the red hat, while a dying king's barrels of gold and silver coins are looted by yet another skeleton; the foolish and miserly monarch's last thoughts still compel him to reach out for his useless and vain wealth, making him oblivious of repentance. In the centre, a sleeping Religious Pilgrim has his throat cut by a robber-skeleton for his money purse; above the murder, skeleton-fishermen catch humanity in a net. In the bottom right-hand corner, a dinner has been broken up and the diners are putting up a futile resistance. They have drawn their swords in order to fight the skeletons dressed in winding-sheets; no less hopelessly, the jester takes refuge beneath the dinner table. The backgammon board and the playing cards have been scattered, while a skeleton thinly disguised with a mask (possibly the face of a corpse) empties away the wine flasks. Above, a woman struggles in vain while being embraced by a skeleton in a hideous parody of after-dinner amorousness. Of the menu of the interrupted meal, all that can be seen are a few pallid rolls of bread and an appetiser apparently consisting of a pared human skull. As the fighting breaks out, a skeleton in a hooded robe mockingly seems to bring another dish, also consisting of human bones, to the table— horrifying a woman with the realisation of mortality. In the bottom right-hand corner: the only spark of humanity is represented by a troubadour who plays a lute while his lady sings; both are oblivious to the fact that behind both of them, a skeleton that plays along is grimly aware that the couple can not escape their inevitable doom. A cross sits in the centre of the painting. Clothes are clearly depicted, as are pastimes such as playing cards and backgammon. It shows objects such as musical instruments, an early mechanical clock, scenes including a funeral service, and various methods of execution, including the breaking wheel, the gallows, burning at the stake, and the headsman about to behead a victim who has just taken wine and communion. In one scene a human is the prey of a skeleton-hunter and his dogs. In another scene, a man with a grinding stone around his neck is about to be thrown into the pond by the skeletons— an echoing of [Matthew 18.6] and [Luke 17.2].

4296	Painted in 1562, Bruegel's depiction of this subject is taken from a passage from the Book of Revelation (12, 2-9) and reveals the artist's profound debt to Hieronymous Bosch, especially in the grotesque figures of the fallen angels, shown as half-human, half-animal monsters. The composition with a central figure placed among many smaller figures was favoured by Bruegel at this time, not only in other paintings such as Dulle Griet, but also in the series of engravings of the Vices and the Virtues which he had just completed for the Antwerp publisher Hieronymous Cock. The archangel Michael and his angels are shown by Bruegel in the act of driving the rebel angels from Heaven.	The image depicts a lively scene of angels and demons fighting in the sky.

4393	The portraits display figures in profile formed by different animals or objects. Earth is represented by land animals, Air by birds, Water by marine creatures and Fire by burning wood and cannons. This series attempts to express harmony out of chaos with wild animals forming distinct faces. Air displays a cornucopia of small birds that combine to create a slender male face. The majority of the birds are only partially visible which allow the artist to create the face and hair. The body is formed by a peacock; the goatee is a tail of a pheasant, and a duck forms the eyelids. The eagle and peacock are references to the Habsburg dynasty. Flint and steel form the nose and ear. Burning wood creates a crown of glowing hair. The double headed eagle, a symbol of the Holy Roman Empire, sits proudly on the torso. Earth is perhaps the most skilfully blended piece the land animals curving together to create a strong, thick face. Antlered creatures surround the head, forming a crown. An elephant creates the cheek and ear while a wolf eating a mouse forms the eyelid and pupil. A full cow represents the neck. Like its siblings, the lion and the fleece are references to the Habsburg dynasty. A chaotic mess of sea creatures create a woman's face. Her breast plate is a crab, turtle and lobster along with an octopus on her shoulder. The animals that make up her head are obscure but a clear crown is formed by the spines on the back of a fish and long pieces of coral. Almost seeming out of place, a pearl necklace lies across her neck framing her face and completing the pattern of order from confusion. She also wears a pearl earring.	The image features two distinct portrayals of a man with a crown of fire. The first man is depicted with a crown of fire on his head, surrounded by a group of people.

4418	It depicts the Biblical parable of the blind leading the blind from the Gospel of Matthew 15:14, and is in the collection of the Museo di Capodimonte in Naples, Italy. The painting reflects Bruegel's mastery of observation. Each figure has a different eye affliction, including corneal leukoma, atrophy of globe and removed eyes. The men hold their heads aloft to make better use of their other senses. The diagonal composition reinforces the off-kilter motion of the six figures falling in progression. The painting depicts a procession of six blind, disfigured men. They pass along a path bordered by a river on one side and a village with a church on the other. The leader of the group has fallen on his back into a ditch and, because they are all linked by their staffs, seems about to drag his companions down with him. A cowherd stands in the background. Bruegel expands the two blind men in the parable to six; they are well dressed, rather than wearing the peasant clothing that typifies his late work. The first blind man's face is not visible; the second twists his head as he falls, perhaps to avoid landing face-first. The shinguard-clad third man, on his toes with knees bent and face to the sky, shares a staff with the second, by which he is being pulled down. The faces and bodies of the blind men, and background detail including the church, are rendered in exceptionally fine detail.	The image depicts a group of people in medieval clothing, possibly knights, standing in a field. They are holding a rope or a long stick, possibly a flag or a weapon, and appear to be engaged in a game or a competition.

The scene captures the essence of medieval life and the camaraderie among the participants.	0.08552631578947369	0.2653061224489796	0.12935323014380842	0.017241379310344827	0.0547945205479452	0.02622950455555009	0.08552631578947369	0.2653061224489796	0.12935323014380842	0.7876983284950256	0.7216405272483826	0.7532238364219666	0.0	0.11279224785066853

4482	The clouds and the chromaticism are similar to his Healing of the Man Born Blind, though most of the tonalities show the influence of Raphael and Michelangelo.	The image depicts a scene of a man and a woman riding a donkey, with the woman holding a baby. They are walking down a dirt road, and the woman is holding the baby close to her. The man is walking beside the woman, and they appear to be enjoying their time together. The donkey is positioned in the middle of the scene, and the overall atmosphere seems to be peaceful and serene.	0.2857142857142857	0.13636363636363635	0.18461538024142018	0.08	0.028985507246376812	0.04255318758488039	0.23809523809523808	0.11363636363636363	0.15384614947218947	0.69194495677948	0.7265195846557617	0.7088108658790588	0.0	0.2192982456140351
4487	An original, much smaller, composition just showing the basic two figures of the standard Pietà subject in Christian art, which consists of Virgin Mary cradling the dead body of Christ, was expanded after being completed and delivered (see below).Behind the central figures there is now a large rusticated Mannerist aedicule or niche, flanked by statues standing on plinths carved with giant lion heads. Along the top of the broken pediment six flaming lamps give a dull light, with another half-hidden in the centre, with vegetation around them, perhaps "the figleaves of the Fall of Man". A patch of dark sky can be seen at top left. Three massive keystone-like blocks in the centre drop below even the bottom of the pediment, a feature typical of the Mannerist architecture of Giulio Romano and his followers. On the left, standing and completing a right-angled triangle of the human figures, is Mary Magdalene, who unlike the other figures seems to be in motion. The two statues at the sides of the grand niche in the background are Moses on the left and the Hellespontine Sibyl on the right, both identified by inscriptions on their pedestals. An putto-angel with a flaming torch illuminates the scene, which is dark and evidently set at night. In particular his torch reveals the gold mosaic in the semi-dome of the niche, where in the centre a pelican feeds its young by pecking its own breast to draw blood, a phenomenon believed since classical times in traditional zoology, which had become a common visual symbol of the Passion of Christ and its redemptive effects for man. In the bottom right corner a small ex voto picture is propped up against the base of the right-hand statue. It shows two men kneeling in prayer to a Pietà in the air. Behind the picture, and partly concealed by it, is a small shield with Titian's coat of arms. In the bottom left corner another young angel is picking up an urn, perhaps the Magdalene's attribute of a jar of ointment.	The image is a painting featuring a group of people, including a man lying on the ground and a woman standing next to him. The scene appears to be a religious or historical event, with the man lying on the ground possibly representing a crucifixion. The woman standing next to him is possibly Mary Magdalene.  In the background, there are two angels, one on the left side and the other on the right side of the painting. Additionally, there are two more people in the scene, one standing near the center and the other on the far right side. A dog can also be seen in the lower left corner of the painting.	0.1291866028708134	0.45	0.20074349095783642	0.03773584905660377	0.13043478260869565	0.05853658188506863	0.12440191387559808	0.43333333333333335	0.19330854671991823	0.8203299641609192	0.7409250140190125	0.7786082029342651	0.0	0.13306587669618317

He appears to be staring directly at the camera, possibly posing for a portrait. The man's attire suggests a formal or historical setting, possibly from the 17th century.	0.2857142857142857	0.11764705882352941	0.16666666253472232	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.2857142857142857	0.11764705882352941	0.16666666253472232	0.7212120294570923	0.7241864204406738	0.7226961851119995	0.0	0.13089005235602094
4501	It shows Saint Lawrence as a deacon in a finely brocaded dalmatic, holding the grill on which he was martyred and looking upwards to a vision of the Madonna and Child on a cloud.	The image features a man dressed in a long, ornate robe, possibly a priest or a religious figure. He is holding a staff in his hand and appears to be looking up at the sky. The man is the main focus of the scene, and his attire and posture suggest a sense of reverence or spirituality.	0.2857142857142857	0.2	0.23529411280276827	0.06060606060606061	0.03636363636363636	0.045454540767045935	0.21428571428571427	0.15	0.17647058339100358	0.7774336338043213	0.7786332368850708	0.7780329585075378	0.0	0.2568262904064399
4502	It shows the Martyred Saint in an atypical kneeling posture which has led some scholars to believe it to be a compositional quotation of various works by other great masters whom the artist admired. The eyes are cast heavenward, either in communion with god or in acceptance of his own impending death. While perhaps slightly elongated, the solitary nude figure is solidly fleshy and certainly shows none of the extreme exaggeration in contrasting highlights or pigmentation for which the artist would later be known. Behind the figure, a somewhat stormy landscape is indicated with loose, gestural brushstrokes. Similar to most portrayals, the saint is shown bound to a tree and pierced in the side with an arrow. Rather than painting a standing figure, as most artists portraying the saint did and as he would in the Prado Sebastian, the Palencia Sebastian is crouched in a kneeling posture, bound to the tree by a rope that passes around a raised arm, the bulk of his weight supported by the large rock on which El Greco signed the painting.	The image features a man with a bow and arrow, standing in front of a tree. He is wearing a loincloth and appears to be a naked figure. The man is holding the bow and arrow in his hands, ready to shoot. The scene is set against a blue sky, creating a dramatic and captivating atmosphere.	0.1271186440677966	0.38461538461538464	0.19108279881374501	0.017543859649122806	0.05555555555555555	0.02666666301866717	0.11016949152542373	0.3333333333333333	0.16560509180737562	0.7997344732284546	0.7247084379196167	0.7603752613067627	0.0	0.11166945840312674
4517	Tarquin raped Lucretia after threatening to kill her if she rejected his advances; this is the moment shown here.	The painting depicts a man and a woman in a bedroom, with the man holding the woman down. The woman is wearing a necklace, and the man is wearing a vest. The scene appears to be a passionate moment between the two individuals.	0.21052631578947367	0.15384615384615385	0.17777777289876556	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.21052631578947367	0.15384615384615385	0.17777777289876556	0.687258780002594	0.6911801099777222	0.6892138719558716	0.0	0.12658227848101264
4518	The act of meeting the two lovers takes place in idyllic, peaceful scenery. On the left stands a naked goddess, with her left hand embracing the arrival of Mars, sitting in front of her in armor. The right hand of Venus rests on the breast from which the milk flows out, emphasizing its femininity. On the right side there is a war horse of god of war, tamed by one of the lovers. Its silhouette is based on antique horse monuments. The underlined musculature of the animal expresses his strength, and his inclined head and calm eyes soften his image. The two putti shown are the key to the interpretation of the work. The second putto, which tied the ribbon around Venus' legs, symbolizes the union of lovers into eternal love and harmony in a time without wars.	The image depicts a man and a woman standing next to each other, with the woman holding the man's hand. They are surrounded by a group of angels, with one angel standing close to the woman and another angel standing close to the man. The scene appears to be a painting or a drawing, with the woman and the man being the main focus of the image.	0.13043478260869565	0.32432432432432434	0.18604650753680677	0.014925373134328358	0.03508771929824561	0.020942404189578972	0.10869565217391304	0.2702702702702703	0.1550387555988223	0.7928480505943298	0.7284551858901978	0.7592888474464417	0.0	0.12253233492171546
4519	He was asked to explain why the painting contained "buffoons, drunken Germans, dwarfs and other such scurrilities" as well as extravagant costumes and settings, in what is indeed a fantasy version of a Venetian patrician feast.

There are at least 14 people in the scene, with some standing and others sitting around the table. The table is adorned with a variety of food items, including a bowl, a cup, and a sandwich.  In addition to the people and food, there are two dogs present in the scene, one located near the center and the other towards the right side.

4573	Christ is portrayed lying in a contorted position, seen from his feet. Differently from Mantegna, Carracci did not paint the mourners at the side, and adopted a more realistic depiction of the body.	The image depicts a man lying on a bed, covered in blood. He appears to be dead, and the scene is quite disturbing. The bed occupies a significant portion of the image, and the man's body is positioned towards the left side of the bed. The blood is spread across the bed, creating a sense of violence and trauma.	0.27586206896551724	0.2	0.23188405309808874	0.03125	0.017857142857142856	0.022727268099174493	0.2413793103448276	0.175	0.20289854585171196	0.7836582064628601	0.7568026185035706	0.7699962854385376	0.0	0.23170731707317074

4615	This Mannerist painting depicts Laudomia Gozzadini (who commissioned the painting) and her sister Ginevra in the foreground, their father Senator Ulisse Gozzadini seated with them, and their husbands Camillo and Annibale standing behind. Ginevra and Ulisse, who are linked by his hand on her arm, were deceased at the time of the painting. Between her and her late family, Laudomia's hand rests on a dog, a symbol of fidelity, perhaps symbolizing her loyalty to their memory. The two women are dressed in full wedding regalia, Laudomia in a bold red that sets her apart from the other more neutrally attired subjects. Camillo's sword and cross signify his identity as a knight of the Portuguese Order of Christ, while the paper in Annibale's hand may allude to his control over the sisters' finances. Correspondence shows that Annibale, the executor of Ulisse's will, owed Laudomia money; over this conflict she took him to court. Painting the sisters in their decadent wedding jewelry, purchased by their father, is interpreted as a reminder that the money they brought with them into their marriages is ultimately of their own inheritance, and not to be withheld from them by their husbands. Compositional support for this theory includes the rendering of the sisters in front of their husbands, taking up much more space, light falling directly onto their faces, while their husbands fade into the dark background.

4636	Boy with a Basket of Fruit, c.1593, is a painting generally ascribed to Italian Baroque master Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio, currently in the Galleria Borghese, Rome. At one level the painting is a genre piece designed to demonstrate the artist's ability to depict everything from the skin of the boy to the skin of a peach, from the folds of the robe to the weave of the basket. The fruit is especially exquisite, and Professor Jules Janick of the Department of Horticulture and Landscape Architecture at Purdue University, Indiana, has analysed them from a horticulturalist's perspective:  The basket ... contains a great many fruits, all in nearly perfect condition and including a bi-colored peach with a bright red blush; four clusters of grapes — two black, one red, and one "white;" a ripe pomegranate split open, disgorging its red seeds; four figs, two of them dead-ripe, black ones, both split and two light-colored; two medlars; three apples—two red, one blushed and the other striped, and one yellow with a russet basin and a scar; two branches with small pears, one of them with five yellow ones with a bright red cheek and the other, half-hidden, with small yellow, blushed fruits. There are also leaves showing various disorders: a prominent virescent grape leaf with fungal spots and another with a white insect egg mass resembling that of the oblique banded leaf roller (Choristoneura rosaceana), and peach leaves with various spots.	A painting of a man holding a basket filled with fruit, including apples and grapes.

4688	The painting shows the martyrdom of Saint Matthew the Evangelist, author of the Gospel of Matthew. Cardinal Contarelli, who had died several decades earlier, had laid down very explicitly what was to be shown: the saint being murdered by a soldier sent by the wicked king, some suitable architecture, and crowds of onlookers showing appropriate emotion.	The image depicts a group of people gathered around a man who is lying on the ground. Some of the individuals are dressed in religious garb, while others are dressed in more casual attire. The scene appears to be a mix of religious and social elements, with people engaging in conversation and interacting with each other. The man lying on the ground seems to be the center of attention, and the people surrounding him are likely discussing or observing the situation.	0.17391304347826086	0.15384615384615385	0.1632653011411913	0.03636363636363636	0.02702702702702703	0.03100774704645231	0.13043478260869565	0.11538461538461539	0.12244897461057913	0.7384413480758667	0.7131741046905518	0.7255878448486328	0.0	0.21455861252192135
4689	The picture shows four boys in quasi-Classical costume, three playing various musical instruments or singing, the fourth dressed as Cupid and reaching towards a bunch of grapes. The central figure with the lute has been identified with Caravaggio's companion Mario Minniti, and the individual next to him and facing the viewer is possibly a self-portrait of the artist. The cupid bears a strong resemblance to the boy in Boy Peeling Fruit, done a few years before, and also to the angel in Saint Francis of Assisi in Ecstasy. The manuscripts show that the boys are practicing madrigals celebrating love, and the eyes of the lutenist, the principal figure, are moist with tears—the songs presumably describe the sorrow of love rather than its pleasures. The violin in the foreground suggests a fifth participant, implicitly including the viewer in the tableau. Scenes showing musicians were a popular theme at the time—the Church was supporting a revival of music and new styles and forms were being tried, especially by educated and progressive prelates such as Del Monte.	The painting depicts a group of people, including a woman, playing musical instruments. The woman is holding a lute, while another person is playing a violin. There are also two other people in the scene, one of whom is holding a book.

4734	It shows a three-quarter-length depiction of a young woman in Tudor-period dress holding a prayer book, with the faded inscription "Lady Jayne" or "Lady Iayne" in the upper-left corner. A faded inscription, reading "Lady Jayne" or "Lady Iayne", is in the upper-left corner, above the woman's shoulders. The subject wears an opulent red gown with turned-back trumpet sleeves and a partlet with standing collar; the latter is embroidered with a fleur-de-lis pattern, the heraldic emblem of French royalty. The design on her  underskirt shows a pattern variously identified as strawberries, gilliflowers, Scots thistles or pinks; the last of these was an emblem of the Grey family. A French hood on her head covers most of her red hair. She wears numerous pieces of jewellery, including a necklace finished with medallions and pearls; these indicate a person of high social and economic status, which is reinforced by the silk and velvet of her gown. Instead she is holding a prayer book.	A woman dressed in a red gown, wearing a necklace and holding a book, is depicted in a painting. The painting is likely a portrait of a woman from the 16th century. The woman's attire and the book she is holding suggest that she might be a scholar or a member of the royal court.	0.16831683168316833	0.4722222222222222	0.24817517860727803	0.04054054054054054	0.11320754716981132	0.05970148865424149	0.1485148514851485	0.4166666666666667	0.2189780983153072	0.8274607062339783	0.7295863628387451	0.7754473686218262	0.0	0.14184656291693576

4738	View of Toledo (original title Vista de Toledo), is one of the two surviving landscapes painted by El Greco. Most notable is the distinct color contrast between the dark and somber skies above and the glowing green hills below. In this painting, he takes liberties with the actual layout of Toledo insofar as certain building locations are re-arranged. However, the location of the Castle of San Servando, on the left, is accurately depicted.	The image is a painting of a cityscape with a large body of water in the foreground. The city is situated on a hill, and the sky above is filled with clouds. The painting captures the beauty of the landscape, with the city's buildings and the water creating a picturesque scene.	0.1206896551724138	0.22580645161290322	0.15730336624668617	0.04285714285714286	0.061224489795918366	0.05042016322293671	0.10344827586206896	0.1935483870967742	0.13483145613432665	0.7960123419761658	0.7556091547012329	0.7752847671508789	0.0	0.2208487649614788

4780	It shows the Biblical David as a young boy (in accordance with the Bible story) fastening the head of the champion of the Philistines, the giant Goliath, by the hair. The light catches on David's leg, arm and flank, on the massive shoulders from which Goliath's head has been severed, and on the head itself, but everything else is dark. Even David's face is almost invisible in the shadows. A wound on Goliath's forehead shows where he has been felled by the stone from David's sling.	The image depicts a scene of a man being strangled by another man. The man who is strangling the other man is wearing a toga, which suggests that the scene might be inspired by ancient Roman culture. The man being strangled is lying on the ground, while the man doing the strangling is standing above him. The scene is quite intense and captures the moment of the strangulation.	0.15	0.21951219512195122	0.1782178169591218	0.025	0.03125	0.02777777283950705	0.15	0.21951219512195122	0.1782178169591218	0.7589654922485352	0.7202920913696289	0.7391232252120972	0.0	0.14485514485514484
4786	The artwork is somewhat overshadowed by the two more famous paintings of Caravaggio on the side walls of the chapel: Both painters were important in the development of Baroque art but the contrast is striking: Carracci's Virgin glows with even light and radiates harmony, while the paintings of Caravaggio are dramatically lit and foreshortened. There is a strong thematic connection with the scene of the Coronation of the Virgin in the central medaillon of the barrel-vault that shows the final episode in the Life of the Virgin after the Assumption. The painting also establishes a dialog with the two Caravaggio canvasses on the lateral walls: the most important figures among the apostles are Saint Peter (the older man on the left) and Saint Paul (on the right) in the foreground whose life story is told by Caravaggio (and also by the side paintings on the vault). The rather crowded composition is organized around a triad of figures: the Virgin rising from the empty tomb (surrounded by a retinue of angels) and the two apostles gazing upwards in awe. All three wear robes in bright primary colours: blue over red (Mary), yellow over blue (Peter) and pink over green (Paul). The remaining space around the sarcophagus is filled with nine other apostles, bringing their overall number to eleven. " John the Evangelist (on the left) is portrayed as a beardless young man among the older and bearded apostles. One member of the angelic retinue can be identified as Archangel Michael who lifted up Mary's body to heaven. An apostle on the right is looking at the grave linens and the roses that were found in the empty sarcophagus. On the other hand the prominent position of the principes apostolorum is a nod to local sensitivities. Mary seems to be projecting forward rather than upwards.	The image depicts a painting of a group of people, including both men and women, gathered around a baby. The baby is positioned in the center of the scene, surrounded by the people who are looking at the child. The people are of various heights and are spread out throughout the painting, with some standing closer to the baby and others further away. The scene appears to be a religious or spiritual gathering, with the baby possibly representing a deity or a symbol of hope and salvation.	0.1016949152542373	0.3157894736842105	0.15384615016107833	0.029304029304029304	0.09411764705882353	0.044692733809026226	0.0847457627118644	0.2631578947368421	0.1282051245200527	0.7907799482345581	0.7056828737258911	0.7458118200302124	0.0	0.11723025456342902

4794	The Cholmondeley Ladies is an early 17th century English oil painting depicting two women seated upright and side by side in bed, each holding a baby. At first sight, the two women and their two babies appear almost identical, each mother wearing white clothes decorated with elaborate lace and jewellery, and each baby swaddled in a scarlet christening robe. The women may be sisters, and they are often thought to be twins due to their close physical resemblance, but the different eye colours - one blue, one brown - mean that they are not identical twins.	The image features two women dressed in ruffled clothing, each holding a baby. The women are positioned close to each other, with one woman on the left and the other on the right. The babies are placed in their respective laps, with one baby closer to the left woman and the other baby closer to the right woman.

Judas then arrives with the Roman soldiers, and Christ's pointing finger seems to indicate their approach.	The image depicts a group of people gathered around a man who is lying on the ground. The man appears to be in distress, possibly due to illness or injury. The people surrounding him are engaged in various activities, with some standing and others sitting. The scene is set in a dark room, which adds to the somber atmosphere.	0.1875	0.1956521739130435	0.1914893567043913	0.03278688524590164	0.034482758620689655	0.033613440381329754	0.1875	0.1956521739130435	0.1914893567043913	0.7472725510597229	0.715897798538208	0.7312487959861755	0.0	0.15602836879432622

4798	The Crowning with Thorns was the subject of two paintings by the Italian master Caravaggio. On June 25, 1605, Caravaggio wrote out, in his own hand, a contract to paint "a picture of the same size and value as the one I have already done for him of Christ's crowning", which restricts the Crowning to a period prior to this date. The gestures which define the situation are restrained and understated—the almost imperceptible actions of the tormentors focus attention on Christ, who looks up, his bound hands slightly raised almost in forgiveness.	The image depicts a scene of a man being crucified, with several people surrounding him. The man is lying on the ground, and there are at least four other people in the scene, with one person standing close to the man being crucified, another person standing further away, and two more people on the right side of the image.  The man being crucified is wearing a crown of thorns, which is a common symbol associated with the crucifixion of Jesus. The people surrounding him appear to be observing the event, with some of them possibly participating in the crucifixion.	0.19444444444444445	0.2413793103448276	0.21538461044260365	0.011111111111111112	0.011363636363636364	0.011235950056813233	0.1527777777777778	0.1896551724137931	0.16923076428875755	0.7433319091796875	0.7156248092651367	0.7292153239250183	0.0	0.22242812659120287
4801	David with the Head of Goliath  is a painting by the Italian Baroque artist Caravaggio. The immediate inspiration for Caravaggio was a work by a follower of Giorgione, c.1510, but Caravaggio captures the drama more effectively by having the head dangling from David's hand and dripping blood, rather than resting on a ledge. The sword in David's hand carries an abbreviated inscription H-AS OS; this has been interpreted as an abbreviation of the Latin phrase humilitas occidit superbiam ("humility kills pride").David is perturbed, "his expression mingling sadness and compassion." No independent portraits of Cecco are known, making the identification impossible to verify, but "[a] sexual intimacy between David/model and Goliath/painter seems an inescapable conclusion, however, given that Caravaggio made David's sword appear to project upward, suggestively, between his legs and at an angle that echoes the diagonal linking of the protagonist's gaze to his victim." The young Caravaggio (his own little Caravaggio) wistfully holds the head of the adult Caravaggio.	The image depicts a painting of a man holding a knife over another man's head. The man holding the knife is positioned on the left side of the image, while the man being held down is on the right side. The scene appears to be a dramatic and intense moment.	0.0847457627118644	0.30303030303030304	0.13245032771018825	0.012578616352201259	0.0425531914893617	0.019417472206146362	0.07627118644067797	0.2727272727272727	0.11920529459760547	0.7778425216674805	0.6846864223480225	0.7282977104187012	0.0	0.08928571428571427

The scene appears to be a painting, capturing a moment of connection between the two individuals.	0.23529411764705882	0.2926829268292683	0.2608695602764651	0.03125	0.037037037037037035	0.033898300120655714	0.21568627450980393	0.2682926829268293	0.23913042984168253	0.789364755153656	0.7513892650604248	0.7699090242385864	0.0	0.20602429149797563
4845	The Virgin with the aid of her son, whom she holds, tramples on a serpent, the emblem of evil or original sin. Saint Anne, whom the painting is intended to honor, is a wrinkled old grandmother, witnessing the event. Flimsy halos crown the upright; the snake recoils in anti-halos. Both Mary and Jesus are barefoot; Jesus is a fully naked uncircumcised child. All else is mainly shadow, and the figures gain monumentality in the light. If this painting was meant to honor the grandmother of Christ, it is unclear how the ungracious depiction of her wrinkled visage in this painting would have been seen as reverent or iconic. One could speculate that the parallel diagonals of Jesus’ phallus and leg suggest that both battle the snake, with one its metaphorical equal.	The image depicts a painting of a woman holding a child, with a snake nearby. The woman is wearing a red dress, and the child is standing next to her. The scene appears to be a religious painting, with the woman and child possibly representing Mary and Jesus. The snake in the painting could symbolize temptation or the devil, adding a deeper meaning to the artwork.	0.17894736842105263	0.40476190476190477	0.24817517823006027	0.047244094488188976	0.09230769230769231	0.06249999552137619	0.17894736842105263	0.40476190476190477	0.24817517823006027	0.8239530920982361	0.7611312866210938	0.7912972569465637	0.0	0.16151685393258428
4847	It depicts the apparition of the barefoot Virgin and naked child to two peasants on a pilgrimage; or as some say it is the quickening of the iconic statue of the Virgin. The Virgin Mary, like her admiring pilgrims, is barefoot. The doorway or niche is not an exalted cumulus or bevy of putti, but a partly decrepit wall of flaking brick is visible. Only the merest halo sanctifies her and the baby. While beautiful, the Virgin Mary could be any woman, emerging from the night shadows.	The image depicts a scene where a woman is holding a baby, and a man is kneeling down in front of them. The woman is wearing a purple dress, and the man is dressed in brown. The baby is being held by the woman, and the man is praying in front of them. The scene appears to be a religious or spiritual gathering, with the baby being the center of attention.	0.1935483870967742	0.3	0.23529411287966176	0.024096385542168676	0.03278688524590164	0.027777772894483882	0.1935483870967742	0.3	0.23529411287966176	0.7849172353744507	0.739840030670166	0.7617123126983643	0.0	0.17689906347554632
4854	This famous portrait shows the Grand Master in formal armour, holding his baton of command, every gleaming inch an image of the military might of the Knights. At the time Wignacourt was about sixty years old. He is placed a little awkwardly within the composition: his feet are aligned with the feet of de Wignacourt, as if standing beside de Wignacourt, but his hand and the helmet overlap Wignacourt's elbow, giving the impression that from the waist up he is in front of the knight. The boy's lively expression and alert gaze make him an attractive subject in his own right, to the extent that he was several times copied by later artists visiting Malta. Wignacourt, encased in splendid black and gold Milanese armour, stares upwards and outwards out of the frame in a dignified manner that invites the viewer to gaze upon him in awe, leaving the page, with his look of boyish interest, as the sole thoroughly human presence, and a far more sympathetic one than the self-conscious man of steel.	The image features a man dressed in medieval armor, holding a large wooden club. He is standing next to a young boy, who is also dressed in medieval attire. The boy is holding a shield, and they both appear to be engaged in a conversation or activity. The scene is set in a dark room, adding to the atmosphere of the medieval period.	0.10833333333333334	0.3023255813953488	0.15950919856976187	0.023809523809523808	0.06896551724137931	0.035398226273005345	0.09166666666666666	0.2558139534883721	0.13496932126914835	0.7985823154449463	0.7180970907211304	0.7562041282653809	0.0	0.1131685430098301
4857	It is one of a series of secular portraits of unknown gentlemen, all of them dressed in black and wearing white ruffs, against dark backgrounds, the most famous of which is El caballero de la mano en el pecho	The image features a man wearing a ruffled collar, a white shirt, and a black vest. He is looking directly at the camera, giving the impression of a portrait. The man's attire and the way he is posing for the picture suggest that he might be a historical figure or a character from a period drama.	0.23529411764705882	0.19047619047619047	0.21052631084487544	0.02631578947368421	0.01818181818181818	0.021505371511158444	0.20588235294117646	0.16666666666666666	0.18421052137119123	0.748497486114502	0.7177366018295288	0.7327944040298462	0.0	0.1473922902494331
4874	As is usual with Caravaggio, light becomes an important element in the drama, picking out crucial details such as Lazarus's hands—one lax and open to receive, the other reaching towards Christ—and the wonder-struck faces of the onlookers.	The image depicts a group of people gathered around a man who is lying on the ground. The man appears to be dead, and the people are attending to him. Some of the individuals are standing, while others are kneeling or sitting around the man. The scene is quite dramatic, with the man lying in the center of attention.	0.20588235294117646	0.1794871794871795	0.19178081694126492	0.05555555555555555	0.03508771929824561	0.04301074794311534	0.14705882352941177	0.1282051282051282	0.13698629639331975	0.7329217195510864	0.7254345417022705	0.729158878326416	0.0	0.16891891891891894

4963	The painting depicts the moment when the resurrected but incognito Jesus, reveals himself to two of his disciples (presumed to be Luke and Cleopas) in the town of Emmaus, only to soon vanish from their sight (Gospel of Luke 24: 30–31). Cleopas wears the scallop shell of a pilgrim. The other apostle wears torn clothes. Cleopas gesticulates in a perspectively-challenging extension of arms in and out of the frame of reference. The standing groom, forehead smooth and face in darkness, appears oblivious to the event. The painting is unusual for the life-sized figures, the dark and blank background. The table lays out a still-life meal. Like the world these apostles knew, the basket of food teeters perilously over the edge.	The image depicts a group of people gathered around a dining table, engaged in a conversation. There are at least four people visible in the scene, with one person sitting on the left side of the table, another person sitting on the right side, and two more people standing near the table.  The table is set with various items, including a wine glass, a cup, a bowl, and a knife. There are also several apples scattered around the table, adding a touch of color to the scene. The atmosphere appears to be friendly and social, with the people enjoying each other's company.	0.1686746987951807	0.21212121212121213	0.18791945815233557	0.05084745762711865	0.0625	0.05607476140798367	0.14457831325301204	0.18181818181818182	0.16107382056844302	0.7607171535491943	0.7135624885559082	0.7363856434822083	0.0	0.17872627903026925
4967	The angel intertwines with the old man, apparently whispering inspiration into his ear. The restless Matthew leans to work, as the angel enumerates for him the work to come. All is darkness but for the two large figures. Matthew appears to have rushed to his desk, his stool teetering into our space.	The image depicts a man sitting at a desk, writing on a piece of paper. Above him, an angel is hovering, seemingly watching over the man as he writes. The scene appears to be a religious or spiritual setting, with the man possibly engaging in a prayer or meditation.	0.23076923076923078	0.225	0.22784809626662403	0.0392156862745098	0.0425531914893617	0.04081632153894272	0.20512820512820512	0.2	0.20253164057042153	0.7659078240394592	0.7503197193145752	0.7580336928367615	0.0	0.16183986371379896
4971	There are seven figures in the painting: from left to right they are John, Jesus, Judas, three soldiers (the one farthest to the right barely visible in the rear), and a man holding a lantern to the scene. They are standing, and only the upper three-quarters of their bodies are depicted. Judas has just kissed Jesus to identify him for the soldiers. The figures are arrayed before a very dark background, in which the setting is obscured. The main light source is not evident in the painting but comes from the upper left; the lesser light source is the lantern held by the man at the right (believed to be a self-portrait of Caravaggio; also, presumably, representing St Peter, who would first betray Jesus by denying him, and then go on to bring the light of Christ to the world). At the far left, a man (St John) is fleeing; his arms are raised, his mouth is open in a gasp, his cloak is flying and being snatched back by a soldier. Two of the more puzzling details of the painting are, one, the fact that the heads of Jesus and St. John seem to visually meld together in the upper left corner, and, two, the fact of the prominent presence, in the very center of the canvas and in the foremost plane of the picture, of the arresting officer's highly polished, metal-clad arm.	The image depicts a group of people gathered around a man who is wearing a metal suit. The man in the metal suit appears to be the center of attention, as the other people are surrounding him. Some of the people are wearing ties, indicating a formal or semi-formal gathering. The scene seems to be a mix of a religious event and a social gathering, with the man in the metal suit possibly being a religious figure or a symbol of unity among the people.	0.11594202898550725	0.32653061224489793	0.17112299078498105	0.03755868544600939	0.10666666666666667	0.055555551703559296	0.10144927536231885	0.2857142857142857	0.14973261645343028	0.7919126749038696	0.7261195778846741	0.7575902938842773	0.0	0.10384542958022754
4973	It shows the ancient Greek philosophers Heraclitus and Democritus.	The painting depicts two men standing next to each other, with one pointing at the other. The man on the left is wearing a red robe, while the man on the right is wearing a black robe. The scene appears to be set in a forest, with trees in the background. The two men seem to be engaged in a conversation or a shared experience.	0.1111111111111111	0.023809523809523808	0.03921568336793563	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.1111111111111111	0.023809523809523808	0.03921568336793563	0.632288932800293	0.6270036101341248	0.6296351552009583	0.0	0.0925925925925926

In the left background is a landscape of the city of Toledo, whilst in the right foreground are three mitres, each representing one of the bishoprics the saint declined (Siena, Urbino and Ferrara).	The image features a man dressed in a monk's robe, standing in front of a cloudy sky. He is holding a staff in his hand and appears to be looking up at the sky. The monk is also holding a book, which he seems to be reading or referring to. The scene captures a moment of reflection and contemplation for the monk.	0.18	0.20930232558139536	0.1935483821251013	0.04477611940298507	0.05084745762711865	0.047619042639204356	0.18	0.20930232558139536	0.1935483821251013	0.7757762670516968	0.7368404865264893	0.7558072805404663	0.0	0.18732875923836712

4980	Self-portrait in a circle of friends from Mantua is an oil on canvas by Peter Paul Rubens, produced between 1602 and 1605. From left to right it shows Frans Pourbus, Caspar Schoppe, William Richardot, the painter's brother Philip or Filippo Rubens, Rubens himself, and Justus Lipsius.

5236	There is some dispute about what cooking process is actually depicted with some suggesting not frying but poaching, leading to an alternative title of the painting, Old Woman Cooking Eggs or Old Woman Poaching Eggs. Old Woman Frying Eggs is considered to be one of the strongest of Velázquez's early works. Like others, it shows the influence of chiaroscuro, with a strong light source coming in from the left illuminating the woman, her utensils and the poaching eggs, while throwing the background and the boy standing to her right into deep shadow. The realism is nearly photographic and shows everyday plates, cutlery, pans, pestles, jugs and mortars, capturing the special shine on a glass surface and the light's play on the melon carried by the boy. The boiling pan is particularly well-captured, with its reflections and the whites of the eggs.	The image depicts a man and a woman standing in a room, with the woman holding a bowl. The man is holding a spoon, and they appear to be preparing food together. The room is filled with various items, including multiple bowls, cups, and a knife. There are also a couple of bottles and a wine glass in the scene. The overall atmosphere suggests a cozy and collaborative cooking session between the two individuals.	0.14285714285714285	0.27450980392156865	0.18791945858474854	0.007575757575757576	0.014285714285714285	0.009900985570044225	0.14285714285714285	0.27450980392156865	0.18791945858474854	0.7787224054336548	0.7274032831192017	0.752188503742218	0.0	0.13451443569553803

5244	The subject of the painting is the waterseller, a common trade for the lower classes in Velázquez's Seville. The jars and victuals recall the bodegón paintings. The seller has two customers: a young boy, possibly painted from the same model as used for the boys in The Lunch and Old Woman Cooking Eggs, and a young man in the background shadows, (time has caused him to fade somewhat – he is clearer in the Uffizi version). In the foreground sit the seller's gigantic pots of water, glistening with splashes of water. The seller hands a freshly poured glass of water to the boy. In it sits a fig, a perfumer intended to make the water taste fresher (something still done in Seville today). His pensive face, battered by its direct exposure to sunlight and deeply scarred with the wrinkles of age, speaks of long years of experience. His short shaved hair and old plain clothes give him the appearance of a monk, saint, or eccentric philosopher. He gazes into nothing, indicating deep thought, almost unaware of those around him.	The image depicts a scene where a man in a brown robe is holding a wine glass, while a young boy is pouring wine into it. The man appears to be a priest, and the boy is likely a young boy in the church. There are two other people in the scene, one standing behind the man and the other standing behind the boy. The setting seems to be a church or a similar religious environment.	0.11290322580645161	0.32558139534883723	0.16766466683495293	0.023121387283236993	0.06153846153846154	0.03361344140774004	0.0967741935483871	0.27906976744186046	0.14371257102656973	0.8038119077682495	0.7272747755050659	0.7636303305625916	0.0	0.12076053442959918

5256	The composition of the painting mirrors other artworks of the time, using diagonal lines to flaunt the female figure and emphasize her movement both in toward the canvas and out towards the viewers. The front of Gentileschi’s body is lit perfectly, but her back is obscured. Across the forehead and cheeks and down the side of the neck and left shoulder a clear line separates the light from the dark, a chiaroscuro technique which was used frequently during the Baroque era to add a sense of drama. The textural element, so important in Baroque paintings, is found in the wisps in the disheveled hair, the crinkles in the sleeve with spilled paint cracking near the wrist, and the dirty hands, which augment the painting's realism. Whereas the darker clothing and background nearly seem to blend together, the pale skin of the face and right arm jump out immediately. The gold chain near the neck shimmers, while the chain near the chest (ending in a mask pendant) slowly dies down into a lacklustre brown.	A woman is painting a picture on a canvas, using a brush to create the artwork. She is focused on her work, and the scene is set in a room with a chair nearby. The woman appears to be the main subject of the painting, and her skill and dedication are evident in the artwork she is creating.	0.10619469026548672	0.3076923076923077	0.15789473302718152	0.024539877300613498	0.07142857142857142	0.03652967655887115	0.10619469026548672	0.3076923076923077	0.15789473302718152	0.8034979104995728	0.7209593057632446	0.7599942088127136	0.0	0.1179047496055111

5274	It shows Queen Sophie (in the centre below the two halves) with five generations of her ancestors, 63 in all, with half-length portraits, coats-of-arms and name plates. Each row covers a generation with the queen's paternal relatives on the right and the maternal ancestors on the left. The value of the images as portraits is however limited to the closest family members, especially those of the queen dowager herself and her parents, which are considered reliable portrayals. By contrast, those of the older generations are imaginative works, often wearing equally imaginative clothing. Inscriptions are in gilded capitals on a dark background. The frame is in the Auricular style with putti and angels. On the cornice below, there are small female figures representing the virtues. Both the upper sections are crowned with angels, one blowing a bassoon, the other waving a palm branch.	The image features two large, ornate wooden panels with intricate carvings and decorations.

5346	The work shows the scene of Judith beheading Holofernes, common in art since the early Renaissance, as part of the group of subjects art critics have called the "Power of Women", which show women triumphing over powerful men. The subject takes an episode from the apocryphal Book of Judith in the Old Testament,  which recounts the assassination of the Assyrian general Holofernes by the Israelite heroine Judith. The painting shows the moment when Judith, helped by her maidservant, beheads the general after he has fallen asleep drunk. The painting is relentlessly physical, from the wide spurts of blood to the energy of the two women as they perform the act. The effort of the women's struggle is most finely represented by the delicate face of the maid, who is younger than in most paintings, which is grasped by the oversized, muscular fist of Holofernes as he desperately struggles to survive. Although the painting depicts a classic scene from the Bible, Gentileschi drew herself as Judith and her mentor Agostino Tassi, who was tried for and convicted of her rape, as Holofernes.	The painting depicts a scene of a man being tortured and killed. Two women are present in the scene, one on the left side and the other on the right side.

5398	The painting contains three figures, Lot and his daughters, centrally placed and surrounded by a landscape setting. Lot is in the center and his two daughters flank each side of him. He is seen in a hunching position resting his head in the lap of his daughter to the left, while the daughter to the right leans back on him for support. As he is laying down it is uncertain whether Lot is sleeping, frightened by the terror going on in Sodom, or simply drunk. His right arm languidly falls over the leg of his daughter that he is laying on and is devoid of tension. He is also in a half fetal position and his body seems relaxed in comparison to the tense nature of his two daughters. On his upper body, the fabric contours to his body and the folds and creases are believable. As the eye scans to his legs, Gentileschi creates an odd placement of the garment on Lot's thigh. The garment has folds and sits bunched up in a way that is not indicative of someone who is laying down. She cradles her father's upper body and shields him both with her right hand that invites his head into her lap, and projects her body forward, leaning over her father and towards her sister. Along with her body, her outfit is dynamic in movement as with the sister to the right. For example, while the daughter's right foot is not visible to the viewer, is it understandable from the draping of the garment that her right leg is crossed and tucked beneath her left leg and her father's head. The daughter to the viewer's right reclines in fear away from what the daughter on the left is pointing at as she leans on her father's body for support.	The painting depicts a group of people, including a woman and a child, sitting on the ground. The woman is pointing at something, possibly a bird, while the child looks on. The scene takes place in a natural setting, with a rock in the background and a tree nearby. There are also two dogs in the scene, one located near the left side and the other closer to the right side. The painting captures a moment of shared interest and curiosity among the group.	0.1342281879194631	0.35714285714285715	0.19512194724854262	0.04182509505703422	0.1375	0.0641399381142213	0.12080536912751678	0.32142857142857145	0.1756097521265914	0.7961360812187195	0.727870762348175	0.7604745030403137	0.0	0.10566692363557108

5432	The unknown subject is in fact not laughing, but can be said to have an enigmatic smile, much amplified by his upturned moustache. The composition is lively and spontaneous, and despite the apparent labour involved in the gorgeous, and very expensive, silk costume, close inspection reveals long, quick brush strokes. The turning pose and low viewpoint are found in other portraits by Hals and here allow emphasis on the embroidered sleeve and lace cuff.	The image features a man wearing a black hat and a white wig, dressed in a suit and a ruffled shirt. He appears to be a courtier or a nobleman, possibly from the 17th century.

6088	The painting catches a moment in which a young man of some wealth is having his fortune told by the old woman at right; she takes the coin from his hand, not only in payment, but as part of the ritual in which she will cross his hand with it. Most or all of the women portrayed are gypsies, and, furthering the stereotype of the time, they are depicted as thieves. As the young man is engrossed in the fortune-telling—an act which, if discovered, would have repercussions for both him and the gypsies—the leftmost woman is stealing the coin purse from his pocket, while her companion in profile has a hand ready to receive the loot. The pale-faced girl on the boy's left is less clearly a gypsy, but is also in on the act as she cuts a medal worn by the boy from its chain. The figures in the painting are close together, as if in a play, and the composition may have been influenced by a theatrical scene.

6155	The painting depicts Jesus and the Apostles during the Last Supper, with Judas dressed in blue turning back towards the viewer and away from the table. Other than Jesus, the most prominent figure is Judas. Judas holds his right hand to his mouth with his eyes avoiding direct contact with the other figures in the painting creating a nervous expression. Jesus is dressed in red and has a yellow halo surrounding his head with his face tilted upwards. Jesus is located centrally in the painting surrounded by his disciples with six on each side, and he holds a loaf of bread with a cup of wine in front of him. Out of all of the figures, he is the most in the light with the figures to the farthest left being the most in shadow. The scene thus represents a perfect conflation of the theological significance of the Last Supper” meaning the conflation between the blessing of the bread and the wine while still being pivotal in the sense of revealing the betrayal.

6174	The painting shows the theme of the ill-matched couple, a popular theme in the arts of the period, though generally the one making the proposition is a man to a courtesan, not a woman to a man. Here a man is sitting sideways on a simple wooden chair with his legs crossed playing the lute. He turns his head to the spectator. Behind him an older woman grasps a money purse with one hand and offers the musician a ring with the other. Both are dressed in simple peasant clothing, but the table has a second money purse and gold coins are spread out for counting from a money box gleaming with metal decorations that seem to contradict the simple characters in the scene. On a small three-legged stool a candlestick rests, but there is no candle in it.	The image depicts a man and a woman sitting together in a room. The woman is wearing a hat and is holding a handbag. The man is sitting on a chair, and they appear to be engaged in conversation or enjoying each other's company. The room features a dining table with a bottle and a bowl placed on it. There is also a chair positioned near the table.	0.16853932584269662	0.3488372093023256	0.22727272287993577	0.04580152671755725	0.09090909090909091	0.06091370112808917	0.16853932584269662	0.3488372093023256	0.22727272287993577	0.8180248737335205	0.7656763195991516	0.7909854650497437	0.0	0.2048949534329651

6183	Both arms draw a subtle curve, instead of forming a triangle. The loincloth is painted rather small, thus showing the nude body as much as possible. The head shows a narrow halo, as if it came from the figure itself; the face is resting on the chest, showing just enough of his features. The long, straight hair covers a great part of the face, perhaps foreshadowing the death, already inflicted as shown by the wound on the right side.	The image depicts a crucifixion scene, with a man wearing a white robe and a crown of thorns on his head. He is hanging on a cross, with his arms stretched out.

6185	Mary appears standing on five cherubim occupying a half moon. She is wearing a necklace with the anagram A(ve) M(aria), while a host of stars and angels emerge from the clouds in the halo around her head. On either side are angels with lilies, roses (attributes of purity) and tablets with inscriptions from the 'Song of Songs'.

6186	Ixion is a 1632 painting, signed and dated by Jusepe de Ribera and showing the torture inflicted on the giant Ixion.	The image depicts a man in a black and white painting, with his body upside down and his feet in the air. He appears to be in a state of distress or agony, possibly due to the flames surrounding him. The flames are spread across the scene, with some closer to the man and others further away. The overall atmosphere of the painting is intense and dramatic.	0.2777777777777778	0.10638297872340426	0.15384614984142023	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.2222222222222222	0.0851063829787234	0.12307691907218948	0.7035377025604248	0.7009899616241455	0.7022615075111389	0.0	0.19572953736654802
6194	(28 x 34 cm), the painting depicts in slightly accelerated perspective two figures in a partially vaulted interior that is dominated by a wooden spiral staircase. The architecture includes stone, brick and wood, with arched elements (window, vault, doors) that create an impression of monumentality. On the pre-iconographic level, this is one of the most "graphic" works painted by Rembrandt, in the sense that it contains many straight, curved, circular, and radiating lines: from the lines of the flagstones to those of the window, the bricks, the wainscotting, and of course the staircase. As in the staircase and the basketwork tray at the center of the composition, the curved lines can be said to organize the straight lines. The first figure is that of an old man seated at a table in front of a window, his head bowed and his hands folded in his lap. The second figure is that of an old woman tending a fire in an open hearth. A third figure—a woman standing in the stairs carrying a basket and turned to the spectator—is visible in 18th- and 19th-century engraved reproductions of the painting, but virtually invisible in the painting's present state.	The image depicts a man sitting in a chair in a dimly lit room. The room features a spiral staircase, and there is a window nearby. The man appears to be reading a book, which is placed on a surface in front of him. The overall atmosphere of the scene is quiet and contemplative.	0.10655737704918032	0.35135135135135137	0.16352200900755515	0.02197802197802198	0.07692307692307693	0.03418803073124442	0.09016393442622951	0.2972972972972973	0.13836477630315266	0.8040115833282471	0.7281951904296875	0.7642276287078857	0.0	0.0903471231573942

6226	Charles I with M. de St Antoine is an oil painting on canvas by the Flemish painter Anthony van Dyck, depicting Charles I on horseback, accompanied by his riding master, Pierre Antoine Bourdon, Seigneur de St Antoine. Charles is depicted as a chivalrous knight and sovereign riding a large, muscular white horse – possibly a Lipizzaner – under a neoclassical triumphal arch, from which is fall hangings of green silk. He is clad in parade armour with the blue sash of the Order of the Garter and carries a baton to symbolise his command of the military. Charles is depicted almost alone, perhaps alluding to the period of his personal rule without Parliament, and is viewed from below, as in van Dyck's 1635 painting Charles I at the Hunt, which disguises the king's lack of stature. To the right stands his riding master, Pierre Antoine Bourdon, Seigneur de St Antoine (with a ribbon around his neck, possibly of the Order of Saint Lazarus) who looks up at the king while holding his helmet. A large Royal coat of arms of the House of Stuart stands to the lower left of the painting – of four quarters: first and fourth the fleur-de-lys of France quartering the three lions of England, second the double tressured lion of Scotland, and third the harp of Ireland – surmounted by a large crown.	The image depicts a man dressed in a suit of armor, riding a white horse. He is holding a sword in his hand, and the horse is positioned in the center of the scene.

In the background, there is a person standing to the right of the knight, possibly observing the scene or waiting for their turn to ride the horse. The overall atmosphere of the image is one of adventure and historical significance.	0.11278195488721804	0.28846153846153844	0.16216215812067214	0.029556650246305417	0.07058823529411765	0.04166666250602858	0.09022556390977443	0.23076923076923078	0.12972972568823973	0.7991865277290344	0.6966548562049866	0.7444067001342773	0.0	0.14216335322225246

6229	While the scene is crowded, each person in the image has a specific facial expression, for the most part wracked with emotion. This emotion is shown in the weeping, open mourning of the women, and the more pensive, silently tense expressions of inner grief displayed by the men. Jesus’ mother, Mary, is portrayed in the work as unconscious, having fainted from the overwhelming grief and sadness. She is portrayed as physically, and likely mentally, supported by the other bystanders. Jesus himself is portrayed in a realistic fashion, with his body slumped and twisted rather unsettlingly as he is carried down the cross displaying the lifeless quality of his form. Jesus’ physical body shape is very rounded, almost Ruben-esque, raising the question of whether Rembrandt was influenced by Rubens’ notably voluptuous figures. Also evident on the body are the marks of the thorn crown and the stigmata on Jesus’ hands and feet. The lightest and brightest areas are on Jesus’ body, promoting it as the focal point of the piece, and the darkest area in the unlit, nearly black, inky background. Various torches and candles provide the light shed on the figures, as the scene takes place at night. Although varying in degree, light specifically illuminates, and delineates, three main groups. These groups are Jesus and the people carrying him, women laying out what appears to be a burial cloth, and Mary and her supporters.	The image depicts a painting of a crowd of people gathered around a ladder, with a man hanging from it. The scene appears to be a religious or historical event, as the man is being crucified. The people in the painting are of various sizes and positions, with some standing closer to the ladder and others further away. The overall atmosphere of the painting is somber and dramatic, capturing the intense emotions and reactions of the onlookers.	0.11688311688311688	0.35294117647058826	0.17560975235978593	0.027649769585253458	0.08108108108108109	0.04123710960947591	0.11038961038961038	0.3333333333333333	0.1658536547988103	0.7992245554924011	0.7400649785995483	0.7685079574584961	0.007993769858309399	0.11003885174073781

All around the group, symbols of matrimonial love can be found including: the cupids, a pair of doves, flower crowns, music making, and Juno’s peacock. The dogs represent loyalty and fealty. The garden represents Paradise, but also fertility. In the far-left corner, a male gentleman escorts a woman in all-black towards the entourage.	The painting depicts a group of people, including both men and women, gathered together in a courtyard. They are dressed in fancy clothing, with some of them wearing ties.

6260	Continuing in the tradition of 16th-century artists who pushed to have painting seen as a profession as opposed to a craft, Leyster chose to depict herself wearing lace cuffs, rich fabric and a huge collar, which would not have been suitable for painting, but draw attention to her wealth and success. While it is unclear whether Leyster studied under Hals the loose brush strokes and casual pose echo his stylistic choices. she is turned partially to the viewer with her lips parted as if to speak. This, along with the fistful of brushes and inclusion of the fiddler from her later painting The Merry Trio, suggest that this piece was calculated to advertise her abilities.

6282	To the usual cast of the Nativity of Jesus in art are added the earlier scene of the Annunciation to the Shepherds in the distance at the centre, five putti above, about to shower the scene with flowers, and a woman at left holding a large wicker tray with fruit. The scene takes place in a large but derelict classical building, to which a crude wooden lean-to stable has been added. The golden stone of the building is echoed by the tanned bodies of the shepherds, the cloudy sky, and other elements, giving an unusually unified "coppery" colour scheme to the painting, with the blue of the Virgin Mary's mantle and that of the woman carrying the fruit the other prominent colour. The ox, to the right of Joseph, almost disappears into the wall behind him. Unlike those in the still central scene, the figures in the small background Annunciation to the Shepherds are highly agitated, with extreme and strenuous poses. The gesturing angel is loosely painted in white against the cloud, just above the foremost vine leaves in the basket. Like other figures by Poussin from this period, the foreground figures seem to have a frozen sculptural quality. The figure with a green dress is female. The foremost kneeling shepherd is close to, and perhaps derived from, a shepherd in a painting of the Nativity by Raphael (Vatican Loggie).	The image depicts a group of people, including angels and a baby, gathered around a cow. The people are kneeling and bowing down to the cow, which is positioned in the center of the scene. The angels are spread out around the cow, with some closer to the left side and others near the right side of the image. The baby is located towards the right side of the scene, surrounded by the people. The overall atmosphere of the painting suggests a religious or spiritual theme.	0.13043478260869565	0.34615384615384615	0.18947368023490313	0.0330188679245283	0.09090909090909091	0.04844290266543775	0.10869565217391304	0.28846153846153844	0.1578947328664821	0.8105064630508423	0.7480086088180542	0.7780044078826904	0.0	0.13506203247582557

6311	Olivares is portrayed on horseback, an honor usually reserved for monarchs and reflects the power he attained as valido or right hand of the king (equivalent to the current prime minister's office). The Count-Duke looks at the viewer, making sure all can witness his feat. The figure is viewed from a low viewpoint and his torso is turned back, making it look more slender; Olivares had a massive body and was rather clumsy, as seen in the portraits that Velazquez had done before. The horse raises its front legs, performing a somersault or levade as it looks toward the battlefield. Drawing a diagonal from the hills that can be seen in the landscape, the composition provides energy to the portraiture; in this dynamism, the work reminds of Rubens. The Count-Duke wears a wide-brimmed feathered hat and the band of the State; the hand holds a marshal's baton, which marks the direction of the battle. The armor he wears is possibly preserved in the Palace of Liria of Madrid (collection of the House of Alba). The battle in the distance is treated with small spots. The landscape is very schematic, as defined Velázquez, with no buildings or characters. The hills fade in green and blue tones, providing a feeling of remoteness, for it is said to have a very sharp aerial perspective.	The image features a man dressed in a suit and hat, riding a horse. The man is holding a sword in his hand, and the horse is positioned in the center of the scene. The man appears to be a knight, and the scene is set in a forest.

6349	It depicts Charles in civilian clothing and standing next to a horse as if resting on a hunt, in a manner described by the Louvre as a "subtle compromise between gentlemanly nonchalance and regal assurance".Van Dyck gives his naturalistic style full expression: "Charles is given a totally natural look of instinctive sovereignty, in a deliberately informal setting where he strolls so negligently that that he seems at first glance nature's gentleman rather than England's King". Charles is dismounted, and stands as if surveying his domain and the sea beyond (perhaps the Solent with the Isle of Wight visible in the distance). His head is turned and his face pinched in a disdainful and somewhat bitter smile. Charles is dressed as an aristocratic gentleman in a wide-brimmed Cavalier hat, teardrop earring, shimmering silver satin doublet, red breeches, and turned-down leather boots, apparently resting during a day of hunting. He is girt with a sword, with one hand resting nonchalantly on a walking stick; the other rests on his hip, holding his gloves as a sign of his sovereignty and assurance.

7382	The painting, sometimes referred to as La Fortuna, depicts Fortuna, the goddess of fortune and personification of luck, pouring her gifts on an array of undeserving animals. Traditionally Fortuna has her eyes covered and the vessel containing her favours, the horn of plenty or Cornucopia, is shown in an upright position; Rosa has reversed this tradition in his rendition and portrays Fortuna completely acquainted with where and on whom she is bestowing her gifts from the upended cornucopia. Gemstones, coronets, a sceptre, gold coins, pearls, roses, together with grapes, cereal, and berries flow from the cornucopia onto the animals below. In turn the animals are stamping on the symbols of education, the arts, and knowledge. The donkey, the symbol of the pope, wearing a  cardinal's red and gold coat as a drapery, is suppressing and casting a shadow on an owl, used here as the symbol for wisdom. The painting is expressing the artist's feelings of bitterness about the fact he lost the papal patronage, and thus Rosa included personal references: a rose signifies Rosa's name; a palette is placed on the book, and the book carries his initials.	The image depicts a scene where a woman is standing on a cloud, surrounded by various animals. She is holding a snake in her hand, and there are several other snakes in the scene.

7478	SCENE IN A COURTYARD In front of a small house with a red roof, red brick walls, and white pilasters, a gentleman and a lady, in a red jacket and yellow skirt, are seated at a small table. The lady, sitting almost with her back to the spectator, is squeezing a lemon into a glass of wine. The gentleman, with his pipe in his right hand, looks on with interest. Behind the couple an older woman comes forward with a glass of beer. At the corner of the house to the right a servant-girl, standing on a tub, is scouring a brass pot. To the right is a wooden fence with an open garden-door, above which rise some trees. To the left of the group is a hedge with trees beyond.	The image depicts a group of people gathered outside a red brick building. There are at least five people visible in the scene, with some sitting on a bench and others standing nearby. The building appears to be a house, and the people seem to be enjoying their time together.

7487	In the middle of a room is a chimney-piece, with a cornice and frieze, supported on pilasters ; a large picture hangs above. To the right are windows in double bays. To the left is seen a second room with a window. The gentleman points with an admiring expression to the roof. In the right foreground is another gentleman, also looking upward ; he is dressed in brown and yellow, with slashed sleeves, and carries a stick. A dog is beside him to the left. A lady, seen in profile, looks out of the window to the right. Around a table before the chimney-piece are grouped six persons, of whom a boy and a little girl face the spectator. High up on the left hangs a large reddish-brown curtain ; the floor is paved with black and white tiles. The wall on the right is covered almost to the ceiling with a striped material. This shows that the scene depicted is the Burgomaster's room in the Amsterdam Town Hall. The dog in the foreground was first placed to the left instead of to the right of the centre. The painting shows a chimneypiece in the larger of these two rooms. At the back in the left doorway is a fantasized version of the doorway to the adjoining mayors' room that in fact overlooks the tribunal, not the outdoors. Today a carpet covers most of the marble floor.	The image depicts a group of people gathered in a large room, possibly a church or a castle. There are at least 13 people in the scene, some of them standing close to each other, while others are more spread out. A dog is also present in the room, standing near the center of the scene.  The room features a large painting on the wall, which adds to the grandeur of the space. The people in the room are dressed in various styles, suggesting a diverse gathering.

7494	The picture, painted in the chaotic Jan Steen "style," depicts a family at home on December 5, the night celebrated in the Netherlands as the Feast of Saint Nicholas, or Sinterklaas. The focal point of the painting is the youngest daughter of the family, a golden-child, painted, in fact, in a golden smock and showing golden locks. She has behaved all year, and Saint Nicholas has rewarded her by stuffing her shoe with a doll and other treats, which she carries in her bucket. She is in stark contrast to her elder brother, standing to her right, who is sobbing, while another brother looks on, laughing. Apparently, the elder brother has been naughty, and his shoe, held up by an elder sister behind him, was left empty. Still there is hope for the sobbing boy. Hidden in the background, almost obscured by the draperies, his grandmother seems to beckon to him—perhaps she is hiding a gift for him too, behind the heavy curtains. While the mother attempts to coax the golden girl to show her the gifts she received, the father, seated in the center of the painting, seems to smile as he remembers his own childhood on this festive night. Further to the right a child can be seen holding a baby and pointing up the chimney, while a younger child looks on in amazement, as he has probably just been told that this was Sinterklaas' method of gaining entry to the house.	The image depicts a lively scene of a group of people, including both adults and children, gathered in a room. They are standing and sitting around a dining table, which is filled with various food items such as apples, oranges, and a bowl. The atmosphere appears to be festive and social, with the people enjoying each other's company and sharing a meal together.	0.09933774834437085	0.29411764705882354	0.14851484771051868	0.008547008547008548	0.03225806451612903	0.01351351020179044	0.09933774834437085	0.29411764705882354	0.14851484771051868	0.7689422369003296	0.7021740674972534	0.7340430021286011	0.0	0.07851397931826884

The lady, seen in profile, has round her head a black veil partly concealing her gold-embroidered bodice, and with her right hand lifts up her yellow skirt. In front of them, to the right, is a dog. The floor is paved with tiles, which are laid in circles in the foreground and in a square pattern farther back. The hall is surrounded by columns on the left and by pilasters on the right. By the wall at the back is a nude statue, between two arched doorways ; the left-hand door is open and looks into another room, the lighting of which is apparently wrong. In this room is a high window, with a table under it  and a chair to the right ; the floor is paved with square tiles. At the back, by the entrance to the room beyond, there was originally the figure of another man, which has been painted out ; the dog also has been repainted in a different way. The curtain, the table-cloth, and the chair-cushion in the back room are vermilion. The cloth over the chest is a dull green. The brushwork even in the background is quite in the manner of P. de Hooch. ; a man with a black cloak is mentioned in the background probably the figure described above as having been painted out.	The image depicts a scene from the past, where a man and a woman are standing in a hallway. The woman is wearing a blue dress, and the man is wearing a red coat. They appear to be engaged in a conversation, with the man holding a hat in his hand.  In the background, there is a dog, possibly a small breed, and a baby can be seen in the scene as well. The hallway is adorned with a dining table and a chair, suggesting that the setting might be a dining area or a room for socializing.	0.14814814814814814	0.3448275862068966	0.2072538818062231	0.04035874439461883	0.1	0.05750798312323315	0.13333333333333333	0.3103448275862069	0.1865284932051868	0.8097126483917236	0.7611404657363892	0.7846755981445312	0.0	0.14950994341761403

7659	The geographer, dressed in a Japanese-style robe then popular among scholars, is shown to be "someone excited by intellectual inquiry", with his active stance, the presence of maps, charts, a globe and books, as well as the dividers he holds in his right hand, according to Arthur Wheelock Jr. "The energy in this painting [...] is conveyed most notably through the figure's pose, the massing of objects on the left side of the composition, and the sequence of diagonal shadows on the wall to the right."Vermeer made several changes in the painting that enhance the feeling of energy in the picture: the man's head was originally in a different position to the left of where the viewer now sees it, indicating the man perhaps was looking down, rather than peering out the window; the dividers he holds in his hand were originally vertical, not horizontal; a sheet of paper was originally on the small stool at the lower right, and removing it probably made that area darker. Details of the man's face are slightly blurred, suggesting movement (also a feature of Vermeer's Mistress and Maid), according to Serena Carr. His eyes are narrowed, perhaps squinting in the sunlight or an indication of intense thinking. The drawn curtain on the left and the position of the oriental carpet on the table—pushed back—are both symbols of revelation. " Since the globe can be identified, we know the decorative cartouche includes a plea for information for future editions—reflecting the theme of revelation in the painting. The cartographic objects surrounding the man are some of the actual items a geographer would have: the globe, the dividers the man holds, a cross-staff (hung on the center post of the window), used to measure the angle of celestial objects like the sun or stars, and the chart the man is using, which (according to one scholar, James A. Welu) appears to be a nautical chart on vellum. That man himself may have been the source of Vermeer's correct display of surveying and geographical instruments, and possibly of his knowledge of perspective.	The painting depicts a man in a robe, possibly a monk, sitting at a desk and looking out the window. He is holding a pen and appears to be reading or writing. The room features a bed, a chair, and a clock on the wall. The man is the main focus of the scene, and the overall atmosphere suggests a sense of contemplation or introspection.	0.09178743961352658	0.4318181818181818	0.15139441941937432	0.028938906752411574	0.140625	0.04799999716920906	0.0821256038647343	0.38636363636363635	0.13545816443929468	0.8132186532020569	0.7131868600845337	0.7599249482154846	0.0	0.08940603825208893

7672	Painted when the artist was fifty-four, it has been noted as a work in which may be seen "the wrinkled brow and the worried expression the troubled condition of his mind". The lift of the eyebrows that wrinkle his forehead is that of whimsical impatience, yet the spark in his eyes denies defeat. The mouth is drawn and the mark of undeserved neglect is evident in the premature wrinkles, but a certain merry pride lurks in the tilted cap and raised head. Yet he never lost his courage, and as we see him in this portrait he carries his head bravely and wears his hat jauntily, as if in defiance of the evils that engulfed him.

7782	Woman with a Pearl Necklace by Johannes Vermeer is a seventeenth-century Northern European painting. Painted in oils on canvas, Johannes Vermeer portrayed a young Dutch woman, most likely of upper-class-descent, dressing herself with two yellow ribbons, pearl earrings, and a pearl necklace. Painted in 1664, this 21 5/8 X 17 ¾ inch scene depicts a young Dutch woman looking left toward a window’s light source. Dressed in a yellow, fur-trimmed coat, this young woman most likely comes from an upper-class family. With Vermeer’s distinctive style, it incorporates the color yellow, a draped curtain, framed pictures on the walls, a light source from the left, as well as domestic tools, and an expressive profile. For example, to the far left, a yellow, drawn back curtain is used. With a rich tone of lemon yellow to complete the woman’s jacket, Vermeer is able to create a balance between the two ends of his painting. The window that the curtain would cover is very similar to that in his painting Woman with a Water Jug. On that same side of the wall, Vermeer displays a framed mirror. The black frame is most likely made of ebony, which indicates wealth and status. The young woman is definitely the most descriptive part of the piece. Like many of his other featured women, she is portrayed in a yellow, fur-trimmed morning coat. As she seems to be finishing up her morning routine, the young woman is caught clasping her pearl necklace together. Her facial expression stares blankly and almost vainly ahead of herself, possibly out the window or into the black-framed mirror. Another important aspect of Vermeer’s Woman with Pearl Necklace is the placement of the domestic tools on the table. A water basin, comb, and powder brush are all displayed on the table. This painting may suggest criticism towards a young upper class women’s frivolity, lack of occupation, and her ample time for petty activities. Lastly, the deep blue tablecloth draped over the left side of the painting brings strong contrast to the work.	A woman is standing in a room, looking at her reflection in a mirror. She is wearing a yellow dress and has a flower in her hair. The room features a dining table and a chair, and there are several items on the table, including a bowl, a vase, and a book.

7856	Landscape with Ascanius Shooting the Stag of Sylvia is a painting of 1682 in oil on canvas by Claude Lorrain (Claude Gellée, traditionally just "Claude" in English), a painter from the Duchy of Lorraine who spent his career in Rome. Both paintings feature large columns on a classical building, a punning reference to the Colonna family, who included such a column in their coat of arms. Aeneas's son Ascanius shoots a stag that is the house-reared pet of Silvia, daughter of "Tyrrheus, chief ranger to the Latian king" (John Dryden's translation), provoking a war with Latium for the future site of Rome. The moment shown is one of stillness, as Ascanius takes aim and the stag, too trusting in its special status, looks at him. Once the arrow is fired the tranquil coastal landscape spreading out behind them will very quickly be disrupted by the war that Virgil goes on to describe. Unusually for Claude, the sky is overcast with storm clouds, and the trees are bent by a wind blowing from the left. The elaborate temple in the Corinthian order has long been falling into ruin.	The image depicts a group of people standing on a hillside, with some of them holding bows and arrows.

7940	The painting is oval shaped, with a width of 107.5 cm and a height of 73 cm. In the foreground it depicts the naked, sleeping Antiope. She lies with her head on the left edge of the painting, twisted so that her front side faces the viewer. Her right arm is bent under her head while her left arm hangs down into the abyss in front of her. This arm covers the right breast, while the left remains free. Her legs are bent up towards the viewer, with the right continuing the line of her body at the knee while her left leg is only slightly bent to point back to the lower right of the painting. The whole body is painted in pale, warm colours and lights up the otherwise dark and earthy image. Under the sleeping woman there is a cloth, which hangs over the abyss near her breast, disappears under her arm near her head and is lifted by the satyr behind her. The satyr, whose head is crowned with grape vines symbolising the presence of the god Bacchus. lies in the opposite direction behind the woman, with the front of his body also facing the viewer.

His left arm is bent on a tree root at the right edge of the image and props up his upper body. With his head and upper body, the satyr looms over the hips of the sleeper in order to gaze upon her - he licks his lips lustfully. His body is shadowy and cannot be made out below his hips. The satyr is depicted in brown tones. His suntanned skin and muscular body forms a clear contrast with the softly worked, shapely Antiope. The lower edge of the image is taken up by an abyss, which is depicted in dark brown tones and is edged with bare soil. On either side, gnarled roots grow in the soil, which rise into indistinct trees. The ground continues above the trees into the background, where there is a hill with lone houses. Above that is the cloudy sky, discreetly lit by the glow of twilight. The composition fits the oval shape of the image. The sleeping Antiope forms the central horizontal, with her hips and bent legs creating the central vertical. The arms of the satyr and the legs of the woman curve in parallel with the upper edge of the painting - in this way the two central characters repeat the oval within the image, which is broken only by dangling left arm of the woman. Spatial depth is created by the stooped posture of Jupiter and by the bent knees of Antiope.	The image depicts a painting of a man and a woman lying on the ground. The man is holding the woman's hand, and they appear to be in a relaxed and intimate position. The woman is lying on her back, and the man is positioned above her.

8080	Strolling Actresses Dressing in a Barn is a painting from 1738 by British artist William Hogarth. The painting depicts a company of actresses preparing for their final performance before the troupe is disbanded as a result of the Licensing Act 1737. The troupe are preparing for the play The leaky, draughty barn stands in for the heavens in which they will shortly be play acting. Like other Hogarth prints, such as Southwark Fair and The Enraged Musician, a pretty woman takes centre stage – in this case, Diana, identifiable by her crescent moon headdress, practising her pose. Her hooped petticoat has fallen to her feet, exposing her thighs, and the low neckline of her shirt reveals her breasts; she is anything but the chaste goddess. To her left Flora is dusting her hair with a flour-shaker in front of a broken mirror propped up by a candle, in an effort to prepare herself for the role of the fertility goddess. Cupid "floats" above them with the aid of a ladder, fetching two stockings for Apollo, identifiable from the sun on his head, who points out with the aid of a bow their hanging place on a cloud beneath a dragon. Next to the actress playing Diana, two children dressed as devils help themselves to a mug of beer left on the altar like a sacrifice. A woman next to them (possibly their mother) is shocked by their behaviour but she has her hands full assisting the "ghost" to bleed a cat from its tail. Above the women in this corner, a face peers down through the opening in the barn roof. He fills the role of Actaeon, who accidentally saw Diana naked and was changed into a stag and torn apart by his own hounds as punishment. In the right foreground, Juno practices her lines, while Night, identifiable by her star-spangled headdress, darns a hole in her stocking. In front of Night and Juno is Hogarth's take on a vanitas, but here the symbols of death are replaced by comic figures: a monkey wearing a cloak urinates into a helmet; one kitten plays with an orb while another plays with a harp; bags and coffee pots litter the table. The monkey and kittens presumably fill the roles of attendants mentioned in the playbill; their play acting as a human serves to highlight further the difference between acting and reality. To the left of the picture, Ganymede, who is not yet fully dressed, accepts a drink of gin to ease the pain of his toothache from the Siren, who is being attended by Aurora, identified by the morning star on her headdress. In the foreground a woman costumed as Jove's eagle feeds her child; the food rests on a crown with a small folded paper bearing the title The Act against Strolling Players. Next to her, Ganymede's breeches lie on the small bed adjacent to the playbill, which is slipping perilously close to the chamberpot.

Each subject looks in a different direction, with no lines of vision intersecting, reflecting the sketch-like nature of the work. The three female figures have similarly youthful appearances, not children but also not old. The male figures progress in age from a boy at the top centre, through a mature man at the bottom centre, to a more elderly man at the top right. The older man is possibly Ben Ives; the other servants may be "Samuel"; Mary Lewis, Hogarth's wife's cousin, who later inherited the painting; and Mrs Chappel, who was known to have worked for the Hogarths in Chiswick. Ronald Paulson believes the servants featured could be a coachman, valet, page, housekeeper and two housemaids. The servants are shown in their natural appearance, in their usual work clothes, capturing their individual characters.	The image is a painting of a group of people, likely a family, dressed in colonial-era clothing. They are all wearing white hats and are posing for a portrait. The painting captures the essence of the time period, with the subjects dressed in long dresses and men wearing ties. The family members are arranged in a row, with some standing closer to the front and others further back. The painting is a beautiful representation of the past, showcasing the fashion and lifestyle of the colonial era.	0.10218978102189781	0.2545454545454545	0.14583332924533432	0.014925373134328358	0.0375	0.021352309094363812	0.0948905109489051	0.23636363636363636	0.13541666257866766	0.8048521280288696	0.7346508502960205	0.7681508660316467	0.0	0.13842226930106527

8374	A Philosopher Lecturing on the Orrery, or the full title, A Philosopher giving a Lecture on the Orrery in which a lamp is put in place of the Sun, is a 1766 painting by Joseph Wright of Derby depicting a lecturer giving a demonstration of an orrery to a small audience. In both of these works, the candlelit setting had a realist justification. Viewing sculpture by candlelight, when the contours showed well, and there might even be an impression of movement from the flickering light, was a fashionable practice described by Goethe. In the orrery demonstration the shadows cast by the lamp representing the Sun were an essential part of the display. But there seems no reason other than heightened drama to stage the air pump experiment in a room lit by a single candle, and in two later paintings of the subject by Charles-Amédée-Philippe van Loo the lighting is normal.	The image depicts a group of people gathered around a large, round globe. There are at least nine people in the scene, with some standing closer to the globe and others further away.

8831	The depiction of full-figure portraits in nature was a speciality of 18th-century English artists, especially Gainsborough who delighted in painting landscapes; Elizabeth with her love for the English countryside was the ideal model for him. Her chin and mouth are firm, definite, and sculptural, and her heavily drawn eyebrows give her a steady, composed, and dignified expression. There is a hint of romantic melancholy in her eyes, with their slightly indirect gaze ... The model's hair is treated in the same manner as the leaves and branches of the trees in the background and some of the sunset's pink glaze is reflected in the colour of her gown. The lonely tree behind her matches her isolated figure and adds to the impression of the remoteness of the abandoned feminine figure in the deserted landscape; possibly longing for something she cannot achieve in her life. A shimmering transparent effect is given to the hand-held scarf by the use of long brush strokes and thin oil colour.	A woman in a pink dress is sitting on a rock, surrounded by trees.

9126	" Goya's yard is overwhelmingly stark, showing shackled inmates enclosed by high walls and a heavy stone arch. Inmates fight and grin idiotically or huddle in despair, all bathed in an oppressive grey and green light, guarded by a single man. The top of the canvas vanishes with sunlight, emphasizing the nightmarish scene below.	The image depicts a group of people in a dark, damp room, possibly a dungeon or a prison cell. There are at least 13 people in the scene, with some standing and others sitting or lying down. The people are gathered around a man who is being held down by others, possibly as a form of punishment or restraint. The overall atmosphere of the scene is tense and unsettling.	0.25	0.24489795918367346	0.24742267541290264	0.018867924528301886	0.014925373134328358	0.01666666173472368	0.22916666666666666	0.22448979591836735	0.2268041187118717	0.7668750882148743	0.7630981206893921	0.7649819254875183	0.0	0.19685039370078738

9130	The Night of Enitharmon's Joy, often referred as The Triple Hecate or simply Hecate, is a 1795 work of art by the English artist and poet William Blake which depicts Enitharmon, a female character in his mythology, or Hecate, a chthonic Greco-Roman goddess of magic and the underworld. The work presents a nightmarish scene with fantastic creatures. One scholar interprets his colour print Hecate thus:  "She is triple, according to mythology: a girl and a boy hide their heads behind her back. Her left hand lies on a book of magic; her left foot is extended. She is attended by a thistle-eating ass, the mournful owl of false wisdom, the head of a crocodile (blood-thirsty hypocrisy), and a cat-headed bat." Geoffrey Keynes wrote about it:  "Hecate, an infernal Trinity, crouches in the centre. An evil winged spectre hovers over her. On her left an ass is grazing on rank vegetation, while an owl and a great toad watch from between rocks.

9223	Despite its title, it depicts Moses cursing the Egyptians with a plague of hail and fire, known as the seventh plague. In the foreground, two dead horses and a dead man are piled together, casualties of the earlier plague of pestilence in livestock. To the right, Moses stands with his arms outstretched, cursing the Egyptians with a plague of hail and fire, far away from the engulfed city. In the background, tumultuous clouds swirl above the Egyptian city, which is denoted by the gleaming, white pyramid in the centre of the canvas. Thin, horizontal lines fall from the clouds, showing streaks of hail falling from the sky. The painting is dominated with dark, neutral tones, creating the feeling of gloom. Although the painting would be categorised as a history painting for its display of a biblical scene, the painting comes across as a landscape painting, clearly demonstrating Turner's training in landscapes. The sky and the scenery take precedence over the figure of Moses and his actions, instead turning him into part of the landscape.	The image depicts a dramatic scene of a stormy sky with dark clouds and lightning. In the foreground, there are several people, including a man and a woman, who appear to be experiencing the storm. Some of the people are lying on the ground, possibly injured or affected by the storm.  In the background, there is a cityscape with buildings and a mountain range. The cityscape is visible through the stormy sky, adding to the overall atmosphere of the scene.	0.1588785046728972	0.3269230769230769	0.21383647358569688	0.04516129032258064	0.09333333333333334	0.06086956082230655	0.14018691588785046	0.28846153846153844	0.18867924088129434	0.8192391395568848	0.7706540822982788	0.7942042350769043	0.0	0.15806589439979574
9226	It portrays a nude woman reclining on a bed of pillows, and was probably commissioned by Manuel de Godoy, to hang in his private collection in a separate cabinet reserved for nude paintings. It has also been cited as among the earliest Western artwork to depict a nude woman's pubic hair without obvious negative connotations (such as in images of prostitutes). Goya's figuration is short and angular, while Velázquez's is elongated and curved, and his figure placed on richly coloured satin, which starkly contrasts to the bare white cloths Goya's maja rests on.

9230	Portrait of Madame Récamier is an 1800 portrait of the Parisian socialite Juliette Récamier by Jacques-Louis David showing her in the height of Neoclassical fashion,  reclining on an Directoire style sofa in a simple Empire line dress with almost bare arms, and short hair "à la Titus". The pose of a reclining figure looking back over her shoulder was adopted in 1814 by Ingres for his Grande Odalisque.	A woman in a white dress is sitting on a couch, holding a cigarette in her hand. She appears to be relaxed and enjoying her time. The couch is positioned in the center of the room, and the woman is the main focus of the scene.	0.17857142857142858	0.3125	0.2272727226446282	0.04477611940298507	0.06818181818181818	0.054054049268728616	0.16071428571428573	0.28125	0.20454544991735552	0.7526328563690186	0.6717170476913452	0.7098765969276428	0.0	0.1804146135045993
9241	The family are dressed in the height of contemporary fashionable clothing, and lavishly adorned with jewelry and honors such as sashes. The painting was modeled after Louis-Michel van Loo's 1743 Portrait of Felipe V and his Family and Velázquez's Las Meninas, setting the royal subjects in similarly a naturalistic and plausible setting as they pose for the artist who is visible at his easel at the left of the canvas. The royal family is apparently paying a visit to the artist's studio, while Goya can be seen to the left looking outwards towards the viewer. Goya seems to focus his attention on three figures: Charles IV, who is dressed in blue, his wife, Maria Luisa of Parma, standing center, and their son Ferdinand. Although a formal portrait, there are indications of intimacy between the family members; Queen Maria Luisa holds the hand of youngest child.	The image depicts a group of people, including a man in a suit and a woman in a dress, standing in a room. They are surrounded by other individuals, some of whom are wearing ties. The scene appears to be a formal gathering or a portrait, with the subjects posing for the picture. The room is furnished with a couch and a chair, and a clock can be seen on the wall. The overall atmosphere suggests a sense of elegance and formality.	0.19	0.34545454545454546	0.24516128574401672	0.02877697841726619	0.05194805194805195	0.03703703244898891	0.17	0.3090909090909091	0.2193548341311135	0.7958714962005615	0.7324395179748535	0.7628391981124878	0.0	0.19608339755172902
9243	The picture has come to symbolize the birth of the Industrial Revolution in the Ironbridge Gorge, Shropshire, England.	The image depicts a group of people walking down a dirt road, with a horse and a wagon following closely behind. The scene appears to be set in a rural area, with a large building in the background. The people are carrying various items, such as a backpack and a handbag. The overall atmosphere of the scene suggests a sense of movement and activity, as the individuals navigate the dirt road and interact with the horse and wagon.	0.3125	0.10416666666666667	0.1562499962500001	0.11764705882352941	0.02702702702702703	0.04395604091776377	0.3125	0.10416666666666667	0.1562499962500001	0.6845822334289551	0.7132811546325684	0.698637068271637	0.0	0.2
9249	The subject's self belief is depicted via his unusual reclining posture, the surrounding horses, and the phallic baton situated between his legs. The artist captures Godoy's arrogance through his posture, and the inclusion of Portuguese flags.	The image depicts a man in a military uniform sitting on a bench, holding a book. He appears to be relaxed and enjoying his time. The scene also includes several other people, some of whom are also sitting on benches. There are two horses in the scene, one located near the left side and the other towards the right side. A couple of swords can be seen, one near the center of the image and the other towards the right side.

9270	The Four and Twenty Elders Casting their Crowns before the Divine Throne is a pencil drawing and watercolour on paper by the English poet, painter and printmaker William Blake. The four and twenty elders fall down before him... and worship him that liveth for ever and ever. God is pictured sitting on his throne at the center of the panel and portrayed as an ancient figure with a long and broad white beard, dressed in red clothing. The Deity holds a book or scroll in his right hand, according to scripture, "written within and on the backside, sealed with seven seals', while his left hand is raised in a gesture of benediction and blessing. His throne is enclosed by a rainbow which radiates from below a pointed Gothic arch formed from the wings of angels. Before the throne is a slain lamb, "having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth". The lamb's seven horns are represented by seven spikes fanned above his corpse, while the seven cherubic heads beneath him allude to the "seven Spirits of God". Each cherub is crowned by a tongued flame, a reference to the "seven lamps of fire" described in Revelation 4.5.In Revelation, Saint John wrote,  And round about the throne were four and twenty seats: and upon the seats I saw four and twenty elders sitting, clothed in white raiment: and they had on their heads crowns of gold. A row of twelve white-clad bearded figures float on either side of the Deity, although only four figures from each row are visible to the viewer of the panel. Each figure bends towards God, in adoration, to lay a golden crown at his feet. Above the head of God are the Four Beasts, "full of eyes before and behind". Above and to the left of God perches the Eagle, opposite of whom is the Lion. Both are portrayed with the pallor of death and both are situated beneath the distorted heads of monstrous birds and animals. The Ox and Angel are positioned behind the throne and peer outwards, according to the Blake collector W. Graham Robertson, "dimly [and] half hidden in the pale crimson and violet rays which emanate from the central figure, and shoot up to meet and be absorbed in the over-arching rainbow."There are many uses of numerical symbolism in The Four and Twenty Elders, and according to the Blake scholar Martin Myrone, "the way, as with [Blake's] Ezekiel's Wheels, that multiples and unities meld into one another, underpinned Blakes own poetic conceptions."The painting was first passed to Butts and upon his death was bequeathed to his son.	The image features a painting of a man sitting on a chair, surrounded by a group of angels. The man appears to be a king, and the angels are positioned around him, some closer to the foreground and others further in the background. The scene is set in a room with a chair and a dining table, adding to the atmosphere of the painting.	0.06640625	0.4146341463414634	0.11447811209831202	0.021686746987951807	0.14516129032258066	0.037735846794914187	0.0625	0.3902439024390244	0.10774410536430529	0.7867254614830017	0.698586106300354	0.74004065990448	0.0	0.05635554609325101

9279	It was probably produced by Goya in his studio, where an 1812 inventory mentions there were eight yellow damask chairs and an associated divan. She wears a black silk dress in the Empire style, then fashionable in Spain, with her arms covered by fingerless white gloves, her hands holding a closed fan and a mantilla on her head and shoulders.	The image features a woman dressed in a black and white gown, sitting on a bench. She is holding a white fan in her hand, and there is a book nearby. The woman appears to be looking at the camera, capturing her attention. The scene is set against a backdrop of a yellow wall, adding a touch of warmth to the overall atmosphere.	0.26	0.29545454545454547	0.27659573970122237	0.03389830508474576	0.03225806451612903	0.033057846242743744	0.2	0.22727272727272727	0.21276595246717986	0.760059118270874	0.7482082843780518	0.7540871500968933	0.0	0.23722026960893353
9281	The decisive gesture of her arms in the akimbo position and her confidence stand out. Her eyes and hair are light brown, her skin is pale, and her body is slightly turned to the left side, while her head gives balance by being turned to the opposite side. One of the unique aspects of this painting is that the woman is looking towards the left side of the viewer and not towards him, which is the case of the majority of Goya's paintings.	A woman wearing a black dress and a black veil is depicted in a painting. She is looking at the viewer with a smile on her face. The painting is in black and white, giving it an old-fashioned appearance.	0.18518518518518517	0.3448275862068966	0.24096385087530856	0.039473684210526314	0.08108108108108109	0.05309734072832678	0.18518518518518517	0.3448275862068966	0.24096385087530856	0.8016934394836426	0.7669950723648071	0.7839605212211609	0.0	0.1325551044083527

9296	It shows Joaquina Téllez-Girón, Marquise of Santa Cruz clad in a very light white dress, lying sideways on a red divan. Her head is decorated with yellow flowers; her left hand is balancing a lyre-guitar. Her gaze does not directly fix on the viewer but seems to look distant. Her body does not seem to sit in a natural position, but seemingly floats on the red divan and the pillows. The flowers on her head are a reference to Bacchus, while the lyre-guitar with its resemblance to the ancient lyre is a homage to art and Apollo.	The image features a woman lying on a bed, wearing a white dress. She is holding a harp, which is placed on her chest. The woman appears to be relaxed and enjoying her time on the bed. The harp is a prominent feature in the scene, and it adds a sense of elegance and musicality to the image.	0.18181818181818182	0.3076923076923077	0.22857142390204094	0.05434782608695652	0.08771929824561403	0.06711408923562034	0.13636363636363635	0.23076923076923078	0.17142856675918378	0.8219941854476929	0.773461103439331	0.7969894409179688	0.0	0.21249878741498437
9306	Although West took considerable trouble about the accuracy of details in his painting, basing the portraits on over 50 survivors of the battle, he produced, as he admitted himself, a picture "of what might have been, not of the circumstances as they happened".	The image depicts a large group of people gathered in a crowded room, with some of them wearing red coats. The people are engaged in various activities, and some of them are holding hats. The room appears to be a mix of a dining area and a living space, with a dining table and chairs visible in the scene. The atmosphere seems lively and social, with people interacting and enjoying each other's company.	0.1111111111111111	0.08333333333333333	0.09523809034013632	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.1111111111111111	0.08333333333333333	0.09523809034013632	0.6969326138496399	0.6918781399726868	0.6943961381912231	0.0	0.15711645101663585
9310	The painting is rendered in bright hues and set against a serene white-blue early spring landscape, the freshness of which was intended to reflect the youth of the sitter. The background is not deeply portrayed; the perspective is shallow and rises—according to the art historian Robert Rosenblum—in "flattened horizontal tiers against which the figure seems crisply silhouetted as if in low relief." Her neck is overly elongated, and the bridge of her nose extends too far. Further, the manner in which the whiteness of the sitter's dress contrasts with the curve of her boa offended some viewers. Today the painting is typically seen as a peak in Ingres's artistic career, and in this work Ingres introduces an emotional link between figurative and landscape art, and the watery scape behind the sitter evokes rhythms with many of the visual themes presented in the rich imagery of the foreground.	A woman in a white dress is holding a white fur stole. She is wearing a brown glove and has a smiling expression. The woman is standing in front of a body of water, which is visible in the background.	0.09900990099009901	0.35714285714285715	0.15503875629108835	0.007194244604316547	0.02631578947368421	0.011299431656293898	0.0891089108910891	0.32142857142857145	0.1395348803220961	0.7767115831375122	0.698788046836853	0.7356922030448914	0.0	0.07323568575233022
9315	The painting shows Napoleon as emperor, in the costume he wore for his coronation, seated on a circular-backed throne with armrests adorned with ivory balls.

He also wears an ermine hood under the great collar of the Légion d'honneur, a gold-embroidered satin tunic and an ermine-lined purple velvet cloak decorated with gold bees. The coronation sword is in its scabbard and held up by a silk scarf. The subject wears white shoes embroidered in gold and resting on a cushion. The carpet under the throne displays an imperial eagle.	The image features a painting of a man dressed in a royal outfit, sitting on a chair and holding a scepter.

9341	The canvas depicts a golden cross with the crucified Jesus silhouetted in profile on a rock atop a mountain, surrounded by fir trees below. The cross, facing toward the sun, reaches the highest point in the picture but is presented obliquely and from a distance. The light from behind the cross darkens the part of the mountain that we see. The low sun may be rising or setting; its five stylized rays travel upward, and one creates a gleam on Christ, suggesting a metal sculpture. Ivy grows at the base of the cross. Friedrich made a number of studies of trees and rocks that can be located in this painting.	The image depicts a beautiful scene of a cross on top of a hill, surrounded by trees. The sun is setting, casting a warm glow on the landscape. The cross stands out against the backdrop of the trees, creating a serene and peaceful atmosphere. The combination of the cross, the hill, and the trees creates a sense of tranquility and spirituality.	0.189873417721519	0.39473684210526316	0.2564102520242531	0.037383177570093455	0.06896551724137931	0.04848484392580391	0.17721518987341772	0.3684210526315789	0.23931623493023602	0.8371677994728088	0.7931312918663025	0.8145548105239868	0.0	0.24164905286815067
9342	It depicts a moment from the aftermath of the bloody Battle of Eylau (7–8 February 1807) in which Napoléon Bonaparte surveys the battlefield where his Grande Armée secured a costly victory against the Russians. The painting portrays Napoleon arriving outside Eylau to survey the battlefield on 9 February 1807, the day after the fighting ended. Some of the figures on the edges of the painting are intentionally cut off to instil a feeling of the work being an actual fragment of a real-life scene. The viewer's attention is immediately drawn to the large pile of corpses in the foreground whose faces are twice life-sized; another soldier, wounded, cries out in a state of madness. A wounded Lithuanian soldier, taken aback by the compassion of the Emperor, pledges his allegiance to Napoléon while another former combatant embraces his leg.	The image depicts a historical scene of a group of people riding horses in the snow. There are at least 13 people visible in the scene, some of them riding horses while others are standing or walking.

9360	The title is posthumous, referring to the culminating event of a three-day carnival in Madrid ending on Ash Wednesday. Masked and disguised revellers are seen dancing their way to the banks of the Manzanares, where a ceremonial sardine will be buried. The  painting is certainly a tribute to the common people, depicting an exuberant crowd carousing on the first day of Lent while other Spanish Catholics worship at church. Yet the celebration takes on a sinister aspect due to the many masked and blank faces (see the detail in "Gallery") surrounding the gaily dancing women in white; the grey, distorted trees and encroaching dark colours; and the eye-catching black banner that parades an unsettling mascot. Such festivals as the "Burial of the Sardine" originated with themes of mortality: masks were worn to ward off the spirits of criminals and those who had died violently.	The image depicts a lively scene of a large group of people gathered in a field, with some of them dancing and others participating in various activities. There are at least 14 people visible in the scene, with some standing closer to the foreground and others further back.  A notable feature of the scene is a large, decorated face that appears to be floating in the air, possibly as part of a performance or a decoration. The people in the field seem to be enjoying themselves, with some of them holding umbrellas, possibly to shield themselves from the sun or rain.  The overall atmosphere of the painting suggests a sense of community and shared enjoyment among the people present.	0.14953271028037382	0.21333333333333335	0.17582417097874667	0.02158273381294964	0.027777777777777776	0.024291493054468368	0.12149532710280374	0.17333333333333334	0.1428571380117137	0.7713303565979004	0.7251230478286743	0.7475132942199707	0.0	0.17632241813602015
9372	The painting depicts an  auto-da-fé (Spanish, "act of faith") by a tribunal of the Spanish Inquisition, being held inside a church. The four accused people are wearing tall, pointed coroza or Capirote (a three-foot tall pointed dunce cap) on their heads and clad in sanbenitos describing their offences. Ringed around the accused are the clerics and Inquisitors and farther back a sea of invited guests fill the church interior, witnessing the drama. Every figure in the foreground is in the light, individualised and well-characterised, whereas the background is occupied by an anonymous mass of people shut in by darkness and a claustrophobic Gothic architecture.	The image depicts a large gathering of people in a church, with some of them wearing funny hats. The people are sitting and standing around, with some of them engaged in conversations. The scene appears to be a mix of a formal event and a casual social gathering.  There are several chairs placed throughout the scene, with some of them occupied by the people. A dining table can be seen in the background, and a few cups are scattered around the area.

With his left hand outstretched, Obrenović waves a large revolutionary flag depicting a red cross centered against a white background. The flag provokes an enthusiastic response from the crowd, members of which raise their swords in salute. Others gesture with their muskets. To the far left, a woman places her child on top of a headstone, and both raise their hands in salute. Beside Obrenović is a priest who gives him his blessing. The priest is bearded, and wears a typical, long black robe and Eastern Orthodox religious headdress. Behind the priest is a large group of Obrenović's followers, most with their swords sheathed and hands emulating Obrenović's three-fingered gesture. To Obrenović's right, a man wearing Turkish clothes (red fez, dolman and shalvar pants) places his hand on the flagpole the rebel leader is holding. Behind him, a large group of mustachioed men wearing similar clothes raise their arms and salute Obrenović.

9512	The painting depicts the view from the chalk cliffs of the Stubbenkammer, at that time one of the most famous lookout points on the island. Two trees, whose leaves cover the upper third of the painting, frame the scenery. Two men and a woman in town clothes gaze in wonder at the view. The thin figure in the middle is usually interpreted as Caspar David Friedrich himself. His hat lies beside him as a sign of humility. He seeks for a foothold in the grass as a symbol of the transience of life and looks into the abyss opening before him—the abyss of death. On the right, the man with crossed arms leans against the trunk of a dying tree and looks far out to the sea. The two tiny sailboats stand as symbols for the soul which opens to eternal life and correspond to the figures of the two men. On the left, the woman in a red dress (who is usually identified as Friedrich's wife Caroline) sits beside an almost dried-up shrub: only the twigs around her face are leafing out. With her right hand she points either at the abyss or at the flowers bordering it. In contrast to the men, who gaze either at the abyss or into the distance, she communicates with the other figures—whether she feels threatened by the abyss or compelled by the natural beauty is unclear. The middle figure is blue, the color of faith; the left figure is red, that of love; and the right figure is green, that of hope.	The image depicts a man and a woman standing on a rocky cliff overlooking the ocean. The woman is wearing a red dress, and the man is wearing a hat. They appear to be enjoying the view and the serenity of the surroundings. The scene is set against a backdrop of trees, adding to the natural beauty of the location.	0.12	0.4864864864864865	0.1925133658097172	0.04329004329004329	0.18181818181818182	0.06993006682356119	0.10666666666666667	0.43243243243243246	0.17112299147816643	0.8332945704460144	0.7294127941131592	0.7779008746147156	0.0	0.10523655422308335

9525	In the foreground, a young man stands upon a rocky precipice with his back to the viewer. He is wrapped in a dark green overcoat, and grips a walking stick in his right hand. His hair caught in a wind, the wanderer gazes out on a landscape covered in a thick sea of fog. Through the wreaths of fog, forests of trees can be perceived atop these escarpments. In the far distance, faded mountains rise in the left, gently levelling off into lowland plains in the east. Beyond here, the pervading fog stretches out indefinitely, eventually commingling with the horizon and becoming indistinguishable from the cloud-filled sky.	The image features a man standing on a rocky mountain top, overlooking a vast landscape. He appears to be enjoying the breathtaking view of the mountains and the clouds below.

9537	In the foreground is a procession of Roman Catholic men dressed in white, wearing pointed hats and whipping their bared backs in penitence. Their backs are bleeding and they pull over-life-size statues of Nuestra Señora dela Soledad, the Ecce Homo and the Crucifixion of Christ. Other devotees, who are kneeling and wearing black hoods, line the route. On the right a man is impaled and all are carrying banners, crosses and lamps. A common feature of the series is the presence of cruelty, here shown by the blood flowing out onto the white garment of the central figure, and two contrasting zones of light and dark – here, all the figures in the foreground are in the light, well-characterised and individualised, but the background is left as an anonymous crowd of the faithful, dimly lit under a cloudy blue sky. The two zones are divided by a dark wall, possibly symbolising the heavy weight of religion.	The image depicts a crowd of people gathered around a statue of a woman. The people are wearing hoods and appear to be participating in a ceremony or event. Some of the individuals are holding objects, such as a knife and a hat.

The Raft of the Medusa portrays the moment when, after 13 days adrift on the raft, the remaining 15 survivors view a ship approaching from a distance. The painting is on a monumental scale of 491 × 716 cm (193.3 × 282.3 in), so that most of the figures rendered are life-sized and those in the foreground almost twice life-size, pushed close to the picture plane and crowding onto the viewer, who is drawn into the physical action as a participant. The makeshift raft is shown as barely seaworthy as it rides the deep waves, while the men are rendered as broken and in utter despair. One old man holds the corpse of his son at his knees; another tears his hair out in frustration and defeat. A number of bodies litter the foreground, waiting to be swept away by the surrounding waves. The men in the middle have just viewed a rescue ship; one points it out to another, and an African crew member, Jean Charles, stands on an empty barrel and frantically waves his handkerchief to draw the ship's attention. The horizontal grouping of dead and dying figures in the foreground forms the base from which the survivors emerge, surging upward towards the emotional peak, where the central figure waves desperately at a rescue ship. The viewer's attention is first drawn to the centre of the canvas, then follows the directional flow of the survivors' bodies, viewed from behind and straining to the right. One follows the mast and its rigging and leads the viewer's eye towards an approaching wave that threatens to engulf the raft, while the second, composed of reaching figures, leads to the distant silhouette of the Argus, the ship that eventually rescued the survivors. Overall the painting is dark and relies largely on the use of sombre, mostly brown pigments, a palette that Géricault believed was effective in suggesting tragedy and pain. Even Géricault's treatment of the sea is muted, being rendered in dark greens rather than the deep blues that could have afforded contrast with the tones of the raft and its figures. From the distant area of the rescue ship, a bright light shines, providing illumination to an otherwise dull brown scene.	The image depicts a group of people on a boat, with some of them holding flags. The boat is filled with people, and it appears to be a crowded and chaotic scene. The people are standing and interacting with each other, creating a lively atmosphere. The boat is situated in the ocean, and the people seem to be enjoying their time on the water.	0.0625	0.3488372093023256	0.10600706456067631	0.012853470437017995	0.08333333333333333	0.022271712606584535	0.0625	0.3488372093023256	0.10600706456067631	0.7926529049873352	0.6871470212936401	0.7361388206481934	0.0	0.05124621476822735
9560	It shows two flying figures hovering over a landscape dominated by a large tabled mountain. Two figures, one male and one female, are shown airborne, hovering above a broad landscape. The woman wears a white dress covered by a red-rose coloured robe. Both seem fearful, she covers the lower half of her face with her robe, his face is deeply disturbed. They are each looking in opposite directions, while he points to a town on top of a mountain on the right of the canvas. Critic Evan Connell notes that the mountain's shape resembles Gibraltar, a refuge for Spanish liberals during the aftermath of the Peninsular War. In the foreground, a row of French soldiers, resembling those from Goya's 1814 The Third of May 1808, take aim at a group of people passing in the lower distance. This group is traveling with horses and wagons, and are perhaps refugees fleeing from the earlier war with France, the victims of whom Goya had detailed so closely in his The Disasters of War.  Writer Richard Cottrell has noted the similarity in the colouring of the 'livid' sky with another work from the Black Painting series, The Dog. In this case the robe of the male flyer brings him almost out of the canvas and much closer to the viewer than the female flyer.	The image depicts a painting of a man flying through the air, with a mountain in the background. The man is pointing his finger, possibly indicating a direction or making a gesture. The painting is set in a desert-like environment, with a group of people and horses scattered around the scene. Some of the people are riding horses, while others are standing or walking. The overall atmosphere of the painting is dynamic and full of action.	0.10810810810810811	0.3333333333333333	0.1632653024239901	0.03317535545023697	0.09722222222222222	0.04946996087053183	0.08783783783783784	0.2708333333333333	0.13265305752603093	0.8165232539176941	0.739532470703125	0.7761231660842896	0.009891915086730197	0.11915077989601386
9562	To the three female figures suspended in the air a fourth figure is added in the foreground. Possibly male, this figure's hands are bound behind him as if he is captive. If this interpretation is true, the fates would be deciding the destiny of the man whose bound hands cannot be opposed to his fate.	The image features a painting of three people riding on a horse. The first person is on the left side of the horse, the second person is in the middle, and the third person is on the right side. Each person is holding a different object, with the first person holding a cup, the second person holding a spoon, and the third person holding a fork.

9590	It shows the head of a dog gazing upwards. The dog itself is almost lost in the vastness of the rest of the image, which is empty except for a dark sloping area near the bottom of the picture: an unidentifiable mass which conceals the animal's body.	The image features a painting of a dog standing in a dark, cloudy environment. The dog appears to be looking up, possibly at the sky or a light source. The painting captures the dog's attention and creates a sense of depth and atmosphere.	0.17647058823529413	0.1875	0.18181817682277332	0.06818181818181818	0.07142857142857142	0.06976743686316964	0.17647058823529413	0.1875	0.18181817682277332	0.816344678401947	0.7941164970397949	0.8050771355628967	0.0	0.18375241779497095
9592	Fight with Cudgels (Spanish: One of the series of Black Paintings Goya painted directly onto the walls of his house sometime between 1820 and 1823, it depicts two men fighting one another with cudgels, as they seem to be trapped knee-deep in a quagmire of mud or sand.	The image depicts two men standing on a hill, engaged in a heated argument. One man is holding a stick, while the other is holding a knife. The scene appears to be a painting, with the men standing in the foreground and the hill in the background. The painting captures the intensity of the conflict between the two men.	0.3023255813953488	0.34210526315789475	0.32098764934003965	0.10638297872340426	0.09433962264150944	0.09999999501800025	0.2558139534883721	0.2894736842105263	0.271604933290657	0.7730449438095093	0.7163028120994568	0.7435929775238037	0.0	0.26496786559927843
9596	It shows a woman commonly identified as Goya's maid, companion and, most likely lover, Leocadia Weiss. She is dressed in a dark, almost funeral maja dress, and leans against what is either a mantelpiece or burial mound, as she looks outward at the viewer with a sorrowful expression. The painting's funereal air is established through the shading of the gray background, the colouring of the model's black veil and maja dress, and her sad or nostalgic expression. She is positioned before an open blue sky, with her body slightly leaning against a rock or mound. Leocadia's head rests on her forearm as she looks thoughtfully towards the viewer and is portrayed in a sympathetic manner. The work is illuminated by a yellow light falling on her face, arm and chest. The background shows a blue and white sky emitting an ocher yellowish noon-light reminiscent of one of his final works, The Milkmaid of Bordeaux.	The image features a woman wearing a black dress, sitting on a rock. She appears to be looking down, possibly contemplating her thoughts or observing her surroundings. The woman is positioned near the center of the scene, with the rock she is sitting on occupying a significant portion of the image.	0.15384615384615385	0.4444444444444444	0.2285714247510205	0.027972027972027972	0.08333333333333333	0.0418848129908723	0.14423076923076922	0.4166666666666667	0.21428571046530615	0.8321453332901001	0.7427271008491516	0.7848976850509644	0.0	0.11882998171846436

9623	Acquired by the Musée du Louvre in 1975, it has been called one of Friedrich's "most compelling paintings."The painting depicts a twisted oak tree, bare but for a few dead leaves, seen against an evening sky. In the distance can be seen the ocean, and Cape Arkona's chalk cliffs, a favorite subject of Friedrich's. Two crows are perched on the oak, while a flock descends toward it. In the darkened foreground are a hacked trunk and the upright stump of another oak. The oak is based on a drawing dated 3 May 1809, to which Friedrich added branches at the left and elongated others so as to stretch its forms across the picture plane; the tree in the painting has the overall shape of a rhombus, its web of contorted branches taking on a dramatic presence. Contrasted with the serene layers of chromatic clouds, the tree's forms have been likened to "many flailing arms. " The foreground may be seen as representing death, with the distant sky offering consoling beauty and the promise of redemption after life. A single dominant oak was also the subject of two later vertical compositions painted by Friedrich.	The image features a large tree with a group of birds perched on its branches. There are at least 13 birds visible in the scene, with some sitting closer to the top of the tree and others scattered throughout the branches. The tree is situated in a grassy area, providing a natural habitat for the birds. The scene captures the beauty of nature and the harmony between the birds and their surroundings.	0.14285714285714285	0.3958333333333333	0.20994474748389857	0.021505376344086023	0.05714285714285714	0.031249996026611836	0.11278195488721804	0.3125	0.1657458524562743	0.8084009289741516	0.7347112894058228	0.7697965502738953	0.0	0.11175898931000972
9624	These German Romantic landscape paintings feature two figures in a dark forest silhouetted by a pastel sky. The works' dark foregrounds and lighter backgrounds create a sharp contrast. The sky suggests that the time is around dusk, with the waxing crescent moon close to setting. A dead, uprooted tree's dark roots and branches contrast with the sky. The same can be said of the dark, shadowy trees and rocks surrounding the couple. The figures themselves are dressed in dark colors and stiff, somewhat formal garments, which also serve to signify their higher class.	The image depicts a scene of two people standing in a forest, with a beautiful sunset in the background. The sun is setting behind them, casting a warm glow on the scene. The two individuals are positioned close to each other, possibly enjoying each other's company or admiring the view.

9627	In the picture, two elderly figures dressed in friar's habits stand before a black background. The man in front has a long grey beard, is tall and rests on a cane. Beside him is a highly-caricatured figure whose face is animal-like. This figure seems to be shouting into the ear of his companion, which might be an allusion to Goya's deafness. Calmly resting on his walking stick with a sad but serene expression, the bearded man recalls the philosophers depicted by Velázquez, which had been copied by Goya. In vivid contrast, the features of his monstrous companion recall the friars depicted by Goya in his Caprichos and Disparates.	The image features a man dressed in a long robe, with a beard and a staff in his hand. He appears to be a wizard or a magician, possibly from a fantasy world. The man is standing in a dark room, possibly a dungeon or a cave, with a sense of mystery surrounding him.	0.189873417721519	0.40540540540540543	0.2586206853106422	0.057692307692307696	0.12	0.077922073536853	0.17721518987341772	0.3783783783783784	0.24137930600029733	0.8050121068954468	0.7438243627548218	0.7732095718383789	0.0	0.15924344157802187
9630	Two Old Men Eating Soup likely occupied a position above the main door to the house, between La Leocadia and Two Old Men. In the image, two elderly figures loom forward from a black background; although they are assumed to be men, their gender is not readily apparent. The mouth of the left figure is drawn into a grimace, possibly from lack of teeth. In stark contrast to this animated expression, the face of the other figure hardly seems alive at all. Its eyes are black hollows and the head in general bears the aspect of a skull.	The image features a painting of two women, one of them wearing a hooded robe. They are sitting at a dining table, with one of them holding a spoon. The table is set with a bowl, a fork, and a knife. The scene appears to be a painting of a meal, with the women possibly enjoying a meal together.	0.1643835616438356	0.3	0.21238937595739693	0.02127659574468085	0.037037037037037035	0.027027022392257915	0.1643835616438356	0.3	0.21238937595739693	0.7961221933364868	0.7540560960769653	0.7745184302330017	0.0	0.16205910390848427
9633	Satan hulks, in the form of a goat, in moonlit silhouette over a coven of terrified witches. Satan preaches from a raised earth mound and is dressed in clerical clothing that may be a soutane. He has a goat-like beard and horns, and stands in silhouette, accentuating his heavy body and gaping mouth, which is depicted as if he is screaming. He holds court before a circle of crouched and mostly terrified women, accepted by art historians as a coven of witches. Some bow their heads in fear, others look towards him in open-mouthed and rapt awe. The women are a mixture of old and young, and have similar twisted features; all but one are scowling, nervous and obsequious. An old woman sits to the right of the goat; her back to the viewer. Her face is half hidden, and she wears a white-hooded headdress resembling a nun's habit. She sits alongside bottles and vials on the ground to her right. The eyes of some figures are lined with white paint. The faces of the two main figures – the goat and the woman to the far right – are hidden. The woman is separated from the group, she is perhaps a postulant about to be initiated into the coven. She may represent Goya's maid and probable lover Leocadia Weiss, whose full-length portrait appears in the same series. The darker areas were achieved by leaving the black under-paint exposed; this is most obvious in the figure of the Devil.	The image depicts a large group of people gathered together, with some of them sitting on the ground. The people are wearing various types of clothing, and some of them are holding books. The scene appears to be a gathering or a meeting, with the individuals engaged in conversation or other activities.

9640	Man Mocked by Two Women or Women Laughing or (Spanish: It shows two women with maniacal smiles seemingly laughing at a simple-minded man who appears to be masturbating  at the right hand of the picture. The work shows three figures, generally thought to be two witch-like women and one man, huddled together against a black background and lit from the front left. The figure at right, facing the viewer, is generally presumed to be male. His hands are around his crotch; he appears to be either masturbating, exposing himself or simply mentally retarded. The two women are likely prostitutes, and leer with mocking expressions and broad sinister smiles, seemingly ignoring the male figure. [a] gaping void" – the subject's open mouth. Women Laughing is often seen as a companion piece to Men Reading; both are vertical rather than horizontal and smaller in scale than the other works.

9656	Included in the depiction are many leaders of the American troops that took part in the siege. The blue sky filled with dark clouds and the broken cannon suggest the battles that led to this event. Within weeks General Washington had deployed a much larger army, and his artillery bombarded the British positions in early October. After American and French troops overran two British strongholds, Cornwallis surrendered on October 19, 1781.In the center of the scene, American General Benjamin Lincoln appears mounted on a white horse. He extends his right hand toward the sword carried by the surrendering British officer, General Charles O'Hara, who heads the long line of troops that extends into the background. On the right are American officers beneath the Stars and Stripes; among them are the Marquis de Lafayette and Colonel Jonathan Trumbull, the brother of the painter. General George Washington, riding a brown horse, stayed in the background because Cornwallis himself was not present for the surrender. The Comte de Rochambeau is on the left center on a brown horse.

9694	It depicts the 81-year-old artist posed in Peale's Museum, then occupying the second floor of Independence Hall in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The foreground of the painting depicts in low light some natural objects of the museum. At the front left, a dead wild turkey sits with Peale's taxidermic tools, brought back by his son Titian and waiting to join the collection to reveal its meaning as a national symbol. To Peale's left lie the bones of a mastodon; the assembled skeleton that shows from behind the curtain was the museum's main attraction. In the painting, the artist invites the viewer into his museum; he pulls back a draped crimson curtain, which divides the painting's space, to reveal the collection. The museum's receding shelves display animal species organized by Linnaean classification, and above them are portraits of revolutionary heroes and other notable Americans, whose placement suggests the position of humans in the great chain of being. In the far background a child represents posterity benefiting from the museum's lessons in natural history.	The image depicts a man in a suit and tie, standing in a museum and holding a red curtain. He appears to be a curator or a museum staff member, as he is dressed in formal attire. The man is positioned in the center of the scene, and the curtain is draped over his arm.

Banks of cloud seem to form a dome above the tree. The crown of the tree is dead, and the top of its trunk and two truncated branches resemble a cross. A shepherd shelters under the leaf-bearing lower branches. His flock of sheep graze beside a pond in the wide grassy meadow around the tree. In the middle distance, villages and a town nestle among other trees and bushes. Tree-clad hills pile up into blue-grey mountains in the background.

9721	This image of Salisbury Cathedral, one of England's most famous medieval churches, is one of his most celebrated works, and was commissioned by one of his closest friends, John Fisher, The Bishop of Salisbury. The artist selected a viewpoint from the bishop's garden and included figures of Dr. Fisher and his wife at the bottom left. The painting embodies the full range of qualities of a quintessentially British landscape painting – the clouds, trees, a water meadow, cattle drinking at the edge of the pasture and the glorious architecture of a medieval cathedral – but all on a human scale. Paintings like this one have so conditioned our view of rural Britain that it is now difficult to imagine a time when the countryside and country life were not held in such high regard.	The painting depicts a serene scene of a large church with a steeple, surrounded by a lush green field. There are several cows grazing in the field, with some closer to the church and others further away. A few people can be seen in the scene, possibly enjoying the peaceful atmosphere or attending to the cows.

9732	The work is more than four meters tall, and shows some of the horror of the wartime destruction visited on the Island of Chios in the Chios massacre. A frieze-like display of suffering characters, military might, ornate and colourful costumes, terror, disease and death is shown in front of a scene of widespread desolation. The vigour with which the aggressor is painted, contrasted with the dismal rendition of the victims has drawn comment since the work was first hung, and some critics have charged that Delacroix might have tried to show some sympathy with the brutal occupiers.	The image depicts a large group of people gathered on a beach, with some of them lying on the sand. There are at least 14 people visible in the scene, with some of them appearing to be in distress. A horse is also present in the scene, standing near the center of the group.  The beach setting is further emphasized by the presence of a boat in the background, located towards the left side of the image.

In Spenser's original poem Amoret has been tortured and mutilated by the time of her rescue, but Etty disliked the depiction of violence and portrayed her as unharmed. Despite being a depiction of an occult ritual, a violent death, a partly nude woman and strongly implied sexual torture, Britomart Redeems Faire Amoret was uncontroversial on its first exhibition in 1833 and was critically well received.	The image depicts a scene of a man and a woman fighting, with the woman holding a sword. The man is lying on the ground, and the woman is standing over him, holding the sword. The woman is wearing a helmet, and the man is wearing a chainmail suit.

10236	The painting is haunting for its evocation of an era in American history-—note, in particular, the liberty cap worn by the older man. The animal in the boat is widely accepted as a bear cub and not a cat.	The image depicts a serene scene of two people in a canoe on a lake, accompanied by a cat. The people are sitting on a blanket, enjoying their time together. The cat is sitting nearby, observing the peaceful moment.

10242	The painting is composed from pale blue, grey, brown, gold and white hues. de Broglie is shown fully frontal, looking out at the viewer with a demure expression, the intensity of which has often been compared to his later portrait of Madame Moitessier. Ingres reintroduces a motif first seen in his 1814 Portrait of Madame de Senonnes, that of the central figure reflected in a background mirror. She wears a heavily folded cold grey-blue satin dress, painted with the same hue as her eyes. Her hair is parted and topped with a crimson ribbon at the back. The dresser before the mirror contains a variety of writing materials, pots and flowers, and a lavishly decorated oriental vase. The central motif of both the final painting and its predecessors is her raised left hand index finger, coyly placed by her mouth, and her sinuous, unnaturally elongated right arm.	A woman in a blue dress is posing for a portrait. She is wearing a gold ring and has a red flower in her hair. The portrait is set in a room with a couch and a chair. There are several vases placed around the room, adding to the overall ambiance.	0.14150943396226415	0.39473684210526316	0.20833332944830252	0.02097902097902098	0.061224489795918366	0.031249996198459667	0.1320754716981132	0.3684210526315789	0.19444444055941362	0.8031088709831238	0.7334511280059814	0.7667010426521301	0.0	0.1225806451612903

10267	The painting, which depicts a forested landscape in wintertime, is currently on display at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. This reputation is reflected in Forest; set in Fontainebleau forest during a winter sunset, Rousseau's scene features a dense thicket of foliage set beneath a sallow sky. Deep colors are employed to add depth to the painting, while the defined lines of the larger trees stand out from the more-amorphous mass of smaller plants. Given that the scene is set in the December of 1854, every branch and is bare, further adding to the character of the painting. Two stooped peasants can be seen in the center of the painting, where they are dwarfed by the empty trees above.	The image is a painting of a forest at dusk. The trees are dark and bare, and the sky is a mix of orange and red hues. The forest is filled with trees, some of which are tilted, and a few birds can be seen flying through the sky. The overall atmosphere of the painting is serene and captures the beauty of the forest at twilight.	0.2073170731707317	0.4358974358974359	0.28099173116863607	0.036036036036036036	0.06557377049180328	0.04651162332950288	0.1951219512195122	0.41025641025641024	0.26446280554880136	0.8252160549163818	0.778358519077301	0.8011026978492737	0.0	0.20516618220903687

10275	In the painting, Prometheus is chained to a rock on Mount Caucasus in Scythia. In Prometheus Bound, the landscape is appropriately desolate; above Prometheus are imposing, snowy mountains and a cold sky. The figure himself blends in with the rocks, a conscious decision of the artist that adds an element of surprise for the viewer when the figure is finally seen; the viewer's surprise emphasizes Prometheus's desperate and desolate situation. Upon further inspection a vulture is seen lower in the painting, swooping up toward Prometheus. The raptor comes at dawn, when the planet Jupiter (the "morning star") is seen in the sky.	The image depicts a man sitting on top of a large rock, overlooking a beautiful mountain landscape. The man appears to be enjoying the serene view, possibly taking a break from a hike or simply appreciating the natural surroundings.

10287	The Cornell Farm (1848) is an oil on canvas landscape by Edward Hicks. The picture depicts the farmland and cattle of Pennsylvanian James Cornell. The horizontal band of livestock across the foreground, although childlike in its simplicity, clearly presents each prize-winning animal as an individual portrait. Hicks' delight in creating ornamental pattern is evident in the arrangement of fences, while the rich red and bright white of the house and barn symmetrically flank this central landscape.	The image depicts a large herd of cattle walking down a road, with a total of 14 cows visible. The cattle are spread out along the road, with some cows closer to the foreground and others further back. The scene is set in a rural landscape, with a barn visible in the background. The cattle appear to be moving in a single file line, creating a sense of order and harmony in the scene.	0.1694915254237288	0.2127659574468085	0.18867924034709874	0.013333333333333334	0.014705882352941176	0.013986008997996792	0.1694915254237288	0.2127659574468085	0.18867924034709874	0.794373631477356	0.7540983557701111	0.7737122774124146	0.0	0.20389735141647194
10296	Rothschild wears a pink satin evening dress with rows of rutching at the hem and lace frills at the collar and sleeves, trimmed with ribbon bows. Her hair is smoothed over her ears and she wears a black velvet toque decorated with ostrich plumes. She is seated on a red velvet sofa, with her arms and legs crossed in a relaxed manner. The portrait is dominated two main elements: her wine-red satin robe and the charm of her facial expression and perfectly oval, almost idealised, face. This warmth is contrasted by the sober and dull brown upper background, which serves to off-set the splendor of the sitter. Typically, Ingres does not adhere to an anatomically correct representation of the visible parts of her body, which appear almost boneless and unusually bent and curved.	A woman wearing a pink dress and a white hat is sitting on a couch. She is holding a book in her hand and appears to be smiling.	0.10526315789473684	0.43478260869565216	0.16949152228526287	0.0234375	0.1111111111111111	0.038709674542351934	0.08421052631578947	0.34782608695652173	0.13559321720051717	0.8036459684371948	0.7108638286590576	0.7544128894805908	0.0	0.1102310140306512

10351	The painting records the funeral in September 1848 of his great-uncle in the painter's birthplace, the small town of Ornans. People who had attended the funeral were used as models for the painting.

10362	The painting depicts the dead body of a woman washed up beneath the arch of Waterloo Bridge, with her lower body still immersed in the water of the River Thames. She is presumed to have drowned after having thrown herself in the river in despair to escape the shame of being a "fallen woman".

10454	The Light of the World (1851–53) is an allegorical painting by the English Pre-Raphaelite artist William Holman Hunt (1827–1910) representing the figure of Jesus preparing to knock on an overgrown and long-unopened door, illustrating Revelation 3:20: "Behold, I stand at the door and knock; if any man hear My voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with Me". The door in the painting has no handle, and can therefore be opened only from the inside, representing "the obstinately shut mind".	The image features a painting of Jesus, wearing a crown and holding a lantern. He is standing in front of a door, possibly a church door, with a tree in the background. The painting captures the essence of Jesus as a powerful figure, with the lantern symbolizing his role as a light in the world.	0.14925373134328357	0.2857142857142857	0.19607842686466753	0.02247191011235955	0.038461538461538464	0.028368789670540476	0.14925373134328357	0.2857142857142857	0.19607842686466753	0.7946410179138184	0.7184299230575562	0.7546161413192749	0.0	0.1678081474499948
10456	Frith made a series of similar pictures, showing groups of people in contemporary scenes, including The Derby Day of 1858, and The Railway Station of 1862 and Private View at the Royal Academy of 1883. The seaside was a place where the different classes, ages, and sexes could mix without the usual barriers. Frith populates the painting with a variety of stock characters - a grandmother with a parasol, a gentleman seated reading a newspaper, an over-dressed "swell", a variety of entertainers and vendors. Frith also included a self-portrait: he is looking over the shoulder of the man on the far right, with two ladies and a girl in white in front. The small girl paddling in the sea near the centre of the painting, staring directly out of the picture, is thought to be his daughter. All are viewed from the sea, looking towards the beach, separating the viewer from the scene. Many of the buildings in the background - the clock tower, the granite obelisk erected in 1822, building with battlements on Harbour Parade, and the gable end of the building at the junction of Albion Place and Madeira Walk above the cliffs - remain recognisable today. Unusually, to modern eyes, the characters are wearing their usual clothes on the beach, including crinolines for the women and waistcoats for the men, alongside more recognisable seaside images of sandcastles, donkey rides, and a Punch and Judy show. Bathing machines are visible in the background, but the painting shows no bathers, only genteel paddling at the edge of the sea.	The image depicts a large group of people gathered on a beach, enjoying their time together. Many of the individuals are sitting or standing, while others are walking around. Some of the people are holding umbrellas, providing shade from the sun.  In the background, there is a building visible, possibly a hotel or a nearby structure. The beach is bustling with activity, and the atmosphere appears to be lively and social.	0.11392405063291139	0.3333333333333333	0.16981131695799223	0.029166666666666667	0.10144927536231885	0.045307439896943115	0.10759493670886076	0.3148148148148148	0.16037735469384132	0.8062278032302856	0.7303168773651123	0.76639723777771	0.0	0.10014566642388929
10458	The painting is traditionally interpreted as Courbet greeted by his patron Alfred Bruyas, his servant Calas, and his dog while traveling to Montpellier.	The painting depicts three men standing on a dirt road, engaged in conversation. One of the men is holding a hat, while another is holding a walking stick. The men are dressed in suits, and there is a dog nearby. The scene also features a backpack and a handbag, suggesting that the men might be travelers.

10513	The Rescue (1855) is a painting by John Everett Millais depicting a fireman rescuing three children from a house fire, with their mother receiving them back into her arms. Millais sought to create the correct effects of light and smoke by using a sheet of coloured glass and by burning planks of wood. This emphasis on fleeting effects of colour and light was a new departure in his art. The painting is also notable for its startling transitions of colour, particularly the dramatic effect by which the sleeve of the mother's nightgown changes from slatey blue to pale pink. Robyn Cooper argues that some criticism of the painting arose from the fact that it depicted a virile working class man rescuing middle class children, while their father is nowhere to be seen. The mother's opened arms seem to greet this strong new man as much as her children.	The image depicts a group of people gathered in a room, with a man holding a child on his shoulders. The child is being held by a woman, who is also holding another child. The scene appears to be a warm and loving gathering, with the people enjoying each other's company.	0.14705882352941177	0.39473684210526316	0.2142857103306123	0.013793103448275862	0.04	0.020512816699540484	0.11764705882352941	0.3157894736842105	0.17142856747346946	0.7831413745880127	0.7011644840240479	0.7398891448974609	0.0	0.11914402515838238
10519	It was first exhibited at the Royal Academy of Arts in 1856.At its first showing Hughes accompanied the painting with an extract from Tennyson's poem "The Miller's Daughter":  Love is hurt with jar and fret, Love is made a vague regret, Eyes with idle tears are set, Idle habit links us yet; What is Love? It shows a distinctly Pre-Raphelite style in which a soft approach to nature and femininity is found. Bright colors and red-haired women as well as an emphasis on nature and symbolism characterize this style which can be found in the late 1800s as a response to industrialization. The painting depicts a young couple at a moment of emotional crisis. The male figure is barely visible, his head bent over the young woman's left hand. The woman is looking down at fallen blossoms, suggesting the end of spring, and of early and young love.	The image features a woman wearing a purple dress and a scarf, standing next to a tree. She appears to be looking at her reflection in a mirror, which is placed on a nearby wall. The scene is set in a garden, with a bench visible in the background. The woman's attire and the presence of the mirror suggest that she might be attending a special event or simply enjoying a moment of relaxation in the garden.	0.1619047619047619	0.3090909090909091	0.21249999548828136	0.02054794520547945	0.04054054054054054	0.027272722808265194	0.14285714285714285	0.2727272727272727	0.18749999548828133	0.769129753112793	0.7110882997512817	0.7389710545539856	0.0	0.15092514849021987

10541	(1851–56) is an unfinished painting by Ford Madox Brown which depicts a woman showing her newborn son to its father. She is offering her baby towards the viewer of the painting, who is implicitly equated with the father - seen in the mirror behind, opening his arms to receive the baby. The mirror also forms a halo behind the mother's head, and the pattern on the wallpaper suggests the starry heavens. The woman is wearing crinolines, which expand to cover the whole of the lower part of the painting.	The image is a painting of a baby being held by a woman. The baby is wrapped in a blanket, and the woman is holding the baby close to her chest. The painting is quite detailed, capturing the emotions and expressions of both the woman and the baby. The scene is set in a room, with a chair visible in the background.	0.22580645161290322	0.4117647058823529	0.2916666620920139	0.06976744186046512	0.10526315789473684	0.08391607912171771	0.20967741935483872	0.38235294117647056	0.2708333287586806	0.8201742172241211	0.7802676558494568	0.7997233867645264	0.0	0.21632473883009729
10574	Prince Diponegoro stands, defiant, in front of Lieutenant General Hendrik Merkus de Kock in front of the colonial officer's mansion. He wears a green turban, white tabard over pantaloons, and a jacket; around his waist is a golden belt, to which prayer beads are attached, and over his shoulder is a shawl. He appears to be struggling to control his anger – as would be expected from Javanese gentry – while the Europeans' eyes are static and avoid the eyes of others. At Diponegoro's feet, a woman – possibly his wife Raden Ayu Rětnaningsih – reaches out to grab him.	The image depicts a large gathering of people, with some standing and others kneeling. A man in a top hat is standing on a stage, possibly giving a speech or addressing the crowd.

10588	The only foreground object is a floating tree trunk, which might be confused for a branch but for its roots, providing a sense of scale. The white foam near the trunk has some build-up of paint on a canvas that is otherwise smooth. The foam might suggest that the tree is caught on an unseen rock; there is ambiguity in whether this location is a small respite of stability or highlights the imminent danger of reaching the fall's edge. Distant on the horizon are a number of buildings, including Terrapin Tower, on the platform of which stands a tiny person.	The image features a large waterfall with a rainbow in the sky above it. The waterfall is surrounded by a rocky landscape, and the scene is painted in a beautiful and vibrant manner. The painting captures the essence of the waterfall and its surrounding environment, making it an impressive and captivating piece of art.	0.11594202898550725	0.21621621621621623	0.15094339168209342	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.10144927536231885	0.1891891891891892	0.13207546715379156	0.7781188488006592	0.7438012361526489	0.7605730891227722	0.0	0.11916110581506197
10592	It depicts a manual labourer who appears to be asleep, worn out by his work, but has actually been worked to death. Many viewers assumed the man was sleeping, worn out by his day of hard but honest labour. Wallis gave no outright statement that the man depicted was dead, but there are many suggestions to this effect. The frame was inscribed with a line paraphrased from Tennyson's A Dirge (1830): "Now is thy long day's work done"; the muted colours and setting sun give a feeling of finality; the man's posture indicates that his hammer has slipped from his grasp as he was working rather than being laid aside while he rests, and his body is so still that a stoat, only visible on close examination, has climbed onto his right foot. The dead man wears the smock of an agricultural labourer which suggests that in former times  he would have been employed year-round on a farm.	The image depicts a man sitting on the ground, possibly in a forest or a mountainous area. He is wearing a jacket and appears to be resting or taking a break. The scene is set against a backdrop of trees and a body of water, which could be a lake or a river. The man's position and the surrounding environment suggest a sense of tranquility and connection with nature.	0.1452991452991453	0.3541666666666667	0.20606060193498635	0.0196078431372549	0.04477611940298507	0.027272723036777514	0.11965811965811966	0.2916666666666667	0.16969696557134997	0.7880265712738037	0.7295441031455994	0.7576584815979004	0.0	0.1442666721653529
10601	Crossing sweepers were a common sight on the streets of large cities during much of the 19th century. For example, the long dresses of many elite women might easily be soiled by horse droppings (among other forms of refuse). "Children also worked as crossing sweepers, and the occupation was regularly portrayed in the art and literature of the day as the work of an impoverished child, usually a boy.

10636	Henri Loyrette wrote:  Low but sometimes steep mountains covered with scrubby vegetation surround a still, shallow lake, boggy at its edges; scattered huts built precariously of wood and thatch suggest a pastoral and nomadic culture. In the foreground a man milks a large mare; behind him, various figures are casually placed, squatting, walking or standing still – a child, an old man, a nursling in its mother's arms, soldiers, resting shepherds. And, dolefully stretched out on a gentle incline, swathed in drapery, lies the figure identified by the painting's title as Ovid. He appears like a fallen meteorite on whom converge the friendly but startled inhabitants of this savage country. At the time of its exhibition, the landscape with its mountains was "universally" praised, while the mare in the foreground was thought strange by some.	The image depicts a group of people gathered around a horse in a field. There are at least 12 people in the scene, with some standing closer to the horse and others further away.

10699	It depicts the moment towards the end of the Battle of Waterloo on 18 June 1815, when the commanders of the allied British and Prussian armies, the Duke of Wellington and Marshal Blücher, met near La Belle Alliance. At the centre of the painting is Wellington, soberly dressed in a plain uniform with cloak and "fore-and-aft" bicorn cocked hat, holding a telescope, and mounted on his horse Copenhagen, shaking hands with Blücher. A French eagle standard lies discarded beneath his horse's feet. Slightly left of centre, Blücher is depicted wearing a forage cap (originally Maclise portrayed him with a feathered cocked hat, but later changed it), and is attended by his generals August Ludwig von Nostitz, Prince Frederick of Prussia, August Neidhardt von Gneisenau, Hans Ernst Karl von Zieten, Friedrich Wilhelm Freiherr von Bülow, and Karl von Grolman.

10714	It depicts a moralising scene at the home of a spendthrift country squire. The old furniture and paintings indicate that the fictional Pulleyne family has occupied Hardham Court for centuries, but the equine print in the lower left corner indicates the reason for the family's reduced circumstances: the father has gambled away the family fortune. Sir Charles Pulleyne, Bt, takes events in his stride, raising a glass of champagne with his young son, but his wife and daughter are more apprehensive. There are advertisements for apartments in the newspaper on the table. The family is reaching the end of its viability: inside, the fire burns low in the grate; outside, the trees show it is the autumn. An older woman - perhaps the grandmother - wipes away her tears as she pays off the butler, who holds the keys to the house.

10807	The figures in the foreground  are the most realistic and dramatic and are treated with more lively colours. The figures in the middle ground of the work are less defined, and those in the background are only suggested and seem to fade into the architecture as if in a fog.

In the bottom section of The Great Day of Girona, or the foreground of the battle, the wounded and dead are depicted, employing maximum realism for the most dramatic images. One figure, situated at the centre of the composition, below the figure of the General, represents the same type of female figure as found in another of Martí Alsina’s works, The Company of Saint Barbara. At the extreme right, the retreating French Army can be seen, the figures blurred to such an extent that they avoid important presence in the composition.

The painting captures the essence of a historical moment, with the people possibly being soldiers or travelers.	0.3142857142857143	0.2619047619047619	0.2857142807556081	0.06666666666666667	0.05454545454545454	0.0599999950500004	0.2857142857142857	0.23809523809523808	0.25974025478158214	0.8008993268013	0.7937946319580078	0.7973311543464661	0.0	0.25193798449612403
11032	Peasant Girl, spinning is the title given by nineteenth century American expatriate artist Elihu Vedder to an oil painting on canvas that depicts a young female figure spinning wool into thread. The painting depicts a young peasant girl, standing in profile on a hillside, transferring wool fibers from a distaff to a spindle that dangles from her right hand. She is barefoot and wears traditional costume consisting of a white shirt with sleeves rolled up, a blue frock, and a tattered red apron that sways in the wind. Strewn rocks and sparse tufts of vegetation punctuate a dry and otherwise barren landscape on what a combination of bright areas of paint and corresponding shadows suggest to have been a hot summer day. In this early work from relatively shortly after Vedder's first arrival in Italy, dramatic movement is conveyed across both horizontal and vertical axes of the picture plane as the girl appears to step forward down the hillside and the spindle whirls, spinning thread from the distaff, midair. The serpentine outline of the girl's arm against the backdrop of the blue sky suggests an elegant line of beauty, which is mirrored in the contours of the apron in the breeze.	A woman in a white dress is holding an umbrella and a bow and arrow. She is standing on a hill, possibly in a field, and appears to be enjoying her time outdoors.	0.08823529411764706	0.46153846153846156	0.14814814545343702	0.025906735751295335	0.16129032258064516	0.044642854758051784	0.08823529411764706	0.46153846153846156	0.14814814545343702	0.8038303256034851	0.6833574771881104	0.7387142777442932	0.0	0.07476303309405047
11036	The winter scene depicts the 17th-century Puritan settlers of New England (later identified specifically as the Pilgrim Fathers) as a small armed group of somberly clad, God-fearing souls making their way from right to left through a snowy, recently cleared wood to a house of worship (a small building visible in the left background). A minister and his wife lead about a half dozen women and children towards the church and are themselves led and flanked by grim looking men with muskets.	The painting depicts a group of people, including both men and women, standing in the snow. They are dressed in winter clothing, with some of them wearing hats. The group appears to be gathered around a tree, possibly for a special occasion or event. The snow-covered ground and the cold atmosphere suggest that the painting captures a moment of togetherness and shared experience in the midst of winter.	0.19402985074626866	0.26	0.22222221732778155	0.024691358024691357	0.030303030303030304	0.027210879405804037	0.1791044776119403	0.24	0.20512820023376446	0.7674184441566467	0.7320048809051514	0.7492935061454773	0.0	0.17494356659142213
11044	The work shows two women dressed in white, one sitting on a sofa and the other resting on the floor. The model on the sofa is Joanna Heffernan, the artist's mistress. The presence of a fan on the floor shows the influence of Japonisme, which was a popular artistic trend in European art at the time.	The painting depicts two women in a room, with one woman lying on a couch and the other woman kneeling beside her. The woman on the couch is wearing a white dress, while the woman kneeling is holding a handbag. The scene appears to be a moment of relaxation and companionship between the two women.	0.3157894736842105	0.3333333333333333	0.3243243193279767	0.09615384615384616	0.09615384615384616	0.09615384115384641	0.3157894736842105	0.3333333333333333	0.3243243193279767	0.8414274454116821	0.794378399848938	0.8172262907028198	0.0	0.2703689504719134
11049	It depicts four figures on a balcony, one of whom is sitting; the painter Berthe Morisot, who married Manet's brother Eugène in 1874. On the right is Fanny Claus, a violinist. The fourth figure, partially obscured in the interior's background, is possibly Léon Leenhoff, Manet's son.	The image depicts a group of three people, two women and a man, standing on a balcony. They are all dressed in fancy clothes, with one of the women wearing a hat. The man is holding a cigar, and the women are holding umbrellas. The scene appears to be set in a fancy, possibly Victorian, era.	0.2564102564102564	0.24390243902439024	0.2499999950031251	0.044444444444444446	0.037037037037037035	0.04040403544536333	0.23076923076923078	0.21951219512195122	0.22499999500312512	0.7749773859977722	0.7286224365234375	0.7510853409767151	0.0	0.22509829238786527
11051	The painting – which features Monet's son Jean sitting next to a white and blue striped cup – is Monet's third painting to feature his son.	A young girl is holding a blue bowl in her hands, looking at the viewer with a frown on her face.

11054	It depicts the French Marshal Michel Ney right after his execution on 7 December 1815, with the firing squad seen walking from the site. On the wall behind Ney's corpse are two inscriptions: one that says "vive l'empereur" ("long live the emperor") and is crossed out, and one that says "vive" right before the bullet holes from the execution.	The image depicts a man lying on the ground, possibly dead, with a group of soldiers standing nearby. The soldiers are positioned in various locations around the man, with some standing closer to the foreground and others further back. The scene appears to be set in a dirt road, with a wall visible in the background. The overall atmosphere of the painting suggests a sense of danger or conflict.	0.15217391304347827	0.14285714285714285	0.14736841605761788	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.13043478260869565	0.12244897959183673	0.12631578447867056	0.7625138759613037	0.7080342769622803	0.7342649102210999	0.0	0.1226158038147139
11055	The painting measures 85 centimetres (33 in) by 59 centimetres (23 in) and is a half-length frontal portrait of a young woman, dressed informally, sitting on a chair beside a wall, possibly on a balcony, with greenery behind. The female figure is carefully finished, but the background is sketched out roughly with bold dashes of colour in broad brushstrokes suggesting sunlit foliage. A thin red hairband pulls her hair back from her face, with dark wavy tresses falling loosely over her shoulders and white bodice. The right strap of the bodice has fallen off her shoulder, creating a very deep neckline. She has a distant expression, gazing to the right of the viewer. Her bare arms lie in her lap, resting on a skirt with red and white stripes, with a few green leaves held in her right hand.	A woman with long hair is sitting on a chair, wearing a red and white dress. She is looking at the camera, and there is a chair next to her. The scene appears to be set outdoors, with a tree in the background.	0.1836734693877551	0.5294117647058824	0.272727268902663	0.06015037593984962	0.19047619047619047	0.09142856778057157	0.16326530612244897	0.47058823529411764	0.24242423859963275	0.8318803906440735	0.7509545087814331	0.7893486022949219	0.0	0.14611693325979044
11058	It depicts the heroine Isabella caressing the basil pot in which she had buried the severed head of her murdered lover Lorenzo. The painting portrays Isabella, unable to sleep, dressed in a semi-transparent nightgown, having just left her bed, which is visible with the cover turned over in the background. She drapes herself over an altar she has created to Lorenzo from an elaborately inlaid prie-dieu over which a richly embroidered cloth has been placed. On the cloth is the majolica pot, decorated with skulls, in which Lorenzo's head is interred. Her abundant hair flows over the pot and around the flourishing plant, reflecting Keats's words that Isabella "hung over her sweet Basil evermore,/And moistened it with tears unto the core." Behind her, next to the doorway, are a pair of pattens, next to the edge of a cassone.	A woman in a white dress is leaning over a table, resting her head on a bowl. The table is adorned with a vase and a skull.	0.09375	0.4090909090909091	0.1525423698477449	0.007352941176470588	0.038461538461538464	0.012345676317635095	0.07291666666666667	0.3181818181818182	0.11864406476299921	0.8169524669647217	0.7154059410095215	0.7628145217895508	0.0	0.0676132521974307
11060	This includes the mistress of the house, young women and their children. Leaning in the corner is a pipe-smoking soldier. The environment is simple, related to their everyday chores, and lit by a daylit window.	The image depicts a large family gathered in a rustic cabin. There are several people sitting and standing around a dining table, which is filled with various items such as bowls, cups, and a bottle. A woman is playing a musical instrument, possibly a piano, while the rest of the family enjoys the gathering. The room is furnished with a bench and a chair, and a clock is visible on the wall. The atmosphere appears warm and inviting, as the family enjoys each other's company in this cozy setting.	0.2413793103448276	0.11290322580645161	0.15384614950368328	0.029411764705882353	0.011904761904761904	0.01694914844010441	0.2413793103448276	0.11290322580645161	0.15384614950368328	0.7648375630378723	0.7893682718276978	0.7769092917442322	0.0	0.20169851380042467
11062	Leenhoff is the focus of the painting, with his back to the other two people, who have at various points been identified as his mother and Manet. These identifications are now seen as incorrect;  the man seated at the table, smoking a cigar and enjoying a coffee and a digestif, is anonymous—although he bears a resemblance to Manet (his friend, the painter Auguste Rousselin has also been suggested). The woman gazing toward the viewer is a servant. Given the uncertain status of Leenhoff's paternity, Meyers proposes that the two figures may nevertheless represent Suzanne and Édouard symbolically, specifically "their belated recognition and acceptance of Auguste [Manet]'s son".In an otherwise muted color scheme, the yellow in Leenhoff's tie, pants, and straw hat connect with the lemon on the table. The armour that appears incongruently in the bottom-left corner recalls its symbolism and collectibility before and during the Second Empire, when it was also the subject of still lifes. The table holds more conventional subjects of the genre, including a peeled lemon, oysters, a Delft sugar bowl, and a knife that protrudes off the table.	The image is a painting of a man in a black suit standing in a room with two women. The man is wearing a hat and appears to be looking at the camera. The women are standing behind him, and there are several cups and bowls placed around the room. A potted plant is also visible in the scene. The painting captures a moment of social interaction between the three individuals.	0.12403100775193798	0.3404255319148936	0.1818181779035383	0.016666666666666666	0.043478260869565216	0.02409638153578235	0.11627906976744186	0.3191489361702128	0.17045454153990197	0.8038684129714966	0.7178961038589478	0.7584537863731384	0.0	0.11679920477137178
11065	According to a contemporary critic it shows the enchantress Medea "...in the act of incantation, the baleful light of her chafing-dish playing in the folds of her robe, and making the pale cheeks look paler, and the ashy lips more ashy, and kindling the array of foul ingredients and witch's properties that surround her tripod - foul toads and strange roots, and images of strange gods, and quaint shells filled with evil compounds."In 1911 the picture was among paintings representative of the best British art sent to Italy for the international exhibition at Rome held in honour of the jubilee of the Kingdom of Italy.	A woman in a white dress is holding a bowl and a knife, possibly preparing food. She is wearing a necklace and appears to be looking at the camera. The scene is set in a room with a dining table and a chair.

11068	It depicts the historic March 28, 1865, strategy session by the Union high command on the steamer River Queen during the final days of the American Civil War.	The image depicts a group of men dressed in military uniforms, sitting and conversing in a room. There are five men in total, with some sitting on chairs and others standing. The men are engaged in a discussion, possibly sharing stories or strategizing.  The room features a couch in the background, and a dining table is visible in the foreground. The men are well-dressed, with some wearing ties, and their attire suggests a formal or professional setting. The atmosphere appears to be relaxed and friendly, as the men enjoy each other's company.	0.16666666666666666	0.06557377049180328	0.09411764300622856	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.16666666666666666	0.06557377049180328	0.09411764300622856	0.6847475171089172	0.681778073310852	0.6832595467567444	0.0	0.14285714285714285
11072	On the wall is a reproduction of Manet's Olympia, a controversial painting at the 1865 Salon but which Zola considered Manet's best work. A Japanese screen on the left of the picture recalls the role that the Far East played in revolutionizing ideas on perspective and colour in European painting.	The image features a man sitting in a chair, holding a book in his hands. The man appears to be reading the book, which is placed in front of him. The room is filled with various items, including a couch, a dining table, and multiple books scattered around. There are also a couple of bottles and a bowl placed on the table. The scene gives off a cozy and intellectual atmosphere.	0.20512820512820512	0.15384615384615385	0.1758241709262168	0.02040816326530612	0.014285714285714285	0.016806717844786365	0.15384615384615385	0.11538461538461539	0.13186812697017286	0.7079964876174927	0.6867071986198425	0.6971893906593323	0.0	0.1736111111111111
11075	The painting depicts a snowscape with a large number of Parisians, young and old, spending leisure time on a frozen park lake. Several dogs can be seen in the work, reflecting Renoir's thematic interest in the lives of the Parisian bourgeoisie.	The image depicts a large group of people gathered in a snowy park, enjoying the winter weather. They are standing and walking around, with some of them wearing coats and hats to stay warm. The park is filled with people of various ages, creating a lively atmosphere.  There are several benches scattered throughout the park, providing seating for the visitors. Some of the people are carrying handbags, indicating that they might be out for a day of leisure or shopping. The overall scene is a vibrant and bustling winter gathering.	0.34285714285714286	0.18181818181818182	0.23762375784726997	0.07692307692307693	0.033707865168539325	0.04687499576293983	0.2571428571428571	0.13636363636363635	0.17821781725321056	0.7659488916397095	0.778947114944458	0.7723932862281799	0.0	0.2385496183206107
11081	Done in oil on canvas, the painting depicts a group of peasant women working the fields of Northern France. One of the paintings produced as a result of this new focus was The Weeders, which Breton painted after observing a group of farmers in his home town of Courrières picking over a field to clear away weeds and thistle.	The painting depicts a group of women kneeling in a field, with the sun setting in the background. They are all wearing long dresses, and some of them are carrying baskets. The scene appears to be a peaceful gathering or a moment of rest during a day of work. The women are spread out across the field, with some closer to the foreground and others further in the background. The overall atmosphere of the painting is serene and captures the essence of rural life.	0.23404255319148937	0.20754716981132076	0.21999999501800013	0.10714285714285714	0.075	0.08823528927335667	0.23404255319148937	0.20754716981132076	0.21999999501800013	0.7644000053405762	0.7625965476036072	0.7634971737861633	0.06430833018968714	0.2352048558421851
11087	As in his earlier picture of the Garden at Sainte-Adresse, Monet concentrated on repetitive elements – the ripples on the water, the foliage, the boats, the human figures – to weave a fabric of brushstrokes which, although emphatically brushstrokes, retain a strong descriptive quality.	The image depicts a lively scene on a lake, with a group of people gathered around a boat. The boat is situated in the middle of the lake, surrounded by several people enjoying the day. Some of the individuals are standing on the boat, while others are sitting or standing nearby.  In addition to the people and the boat, there are a few boats visible in the background, adding to the overall atmosphere of the scene. The presence of multiple boats and people suggests that this could be a popular spot for boating and socializing.	0.17142857142857143	0.1016949152542373	0.12765956979402462	0.046511627906976744	0.02247191011235955	0.030303025910239388	0.17142857142857143	0.1016949152542373	0.12765956979402462	0.7332190275192261	0.7075763940811157	0.7201695442199707	0.0	0.18617021276595744
11093	The painting shows a girl ("the elder sister") sitting on a rock and holding a sleeping baby ("the younger brother") on her lap, with a quiet rural landscape behind them. The beauty of the girl and her eyes, which are looking directly at the viewer, as well the balance of the composition, including positioning of the legs and arms of the children, demonstrate Bouguereau's academic painting style.	A young girl is sitting on a rock, holding a baby in her arms. The baby is sleeping peacefully, and the girl appears to be enjoying the moment. The scene is set in a natural environment, with a grassy area visible in the background.	0.2708333333333333	0.40625	0.32499999520000006	0.07936507936507936	0.11627906976744186	0.09433961781950898	0.25	0.375	0.29999999520000004	0.8348816633224487	0.7601053714752197	0.7957406640052795	0.0	0.18751731888959455
11094	The Execution of Emperor Maximilian is a series of paintings by Édouard Manet from 1867 to 1869, depicting the execution by firing squad of Emperor Maximilian I of the short-lived Second Mexican Empire.	The image depicts a group of men in uniforms, possibly soldiers, standing in a courtyard. They are holding guns and appear to be preparing to shoot a man who is kneeling in front of them.

11437	Dr. Samuel D. Gross, a seventy-year-old professor dressed in a black frock coat, lectures a group of Jefferson Medical College students. Included among the group is a self-portrait of Eakins, who is seen at the right-hand side of the painting, next to the tunnel railing, with a white cuffed sleeve sketching or writing. Seen over Dr. Gross's right shoulder is the clinic clerk, Dr. Franklin West, taking notes on the operation. Eakins's signature is painted into the painting, on the front of the surgical table. The painting is based on a surgery witnessed by Eakins, in which Gross treated a young man for osteomyelitis of the femur. Gross is pictured here performing a conservative operation as opposed to an amputation (which is how the patient would normally have been treated in previous decades). Here, surgeons crowd around the anesthetized patient in their frock coats. It is assumed that the patient depicted in The Gross Clinic was a teenage boy, although the exposed body is not entirely discernible as male or female; the painting is shocking for both the odd presentation of this figure and the matter-of-fact goriness of the procedure. Adding to the drama is the lone woman in the painting seen in the middle ground, possibly the patient's mother, cringing in distress. Her dramatic figure functions as a strong contrast to the calm, professional demeanor of the men who surround the patient.	The image depicts a group of people gathered in a room, with some of them sitting on a bench. A man in a suit is standing in the center of the room, holding a pair of scissors.

Mrs Monet's veil is blown by the wind, as is her billowing white dress; the waving grass of the meadow is echoed by the green underside of her parasol.

The men are in a dark, wood-panelled Victorian parlour with a quality of light suggesting late afternoon. The game is well in progress, as many pieces have been removed from the board. Holmes, the younger player, seems to be winning the match, as he has taken the queen of his opponent (the top of which pokes out of the table's drawer), and his own black queen is well-positioned in the centre of the board. The younger chess player's attempt to kill the older player's king is analogous to the Oedipal complex. In the way that his father Benjamin is placed in opposition to Eakins the painter, the two may be envisioned as playing out a psychological "conflict" across the other axis of the chess board. Yet Eakins has obscured his father's face by shadow and by the angle at which he looks down upon the game.	The image depicts a group of three men sitting around a dining table, engaged in a game of chess. They are all dressed in suits, with one man wearing a tie.

11796	This particular mountain, that stood out in the surrounding landscape, he could see from his house, and he painted it in on numerous occasions. Moreover, Cézanne depicted the railway bridge on the Aix-Marseille line at the Arc River Valley in the center on the right side of this picture. The painting shows clearly Cézanne's project of rendering order and clarity to natural scenes, without giving up the optical realism of Impressionism.	The painting depicts a mountainous landscape with a village nestled in the valley below. The village is surrounded by a lush green field, and the mountain range serves as a stunning backdrop. The scene is painted in a vibrant color palette, with the mountain range appearing in shades of blue and the village in shades of red. The painting captures the beauty of the natural world and the harmony between the village and its surroundings.	0.14035087719298245	0.18181818181818182	0.15841583666699358	0.029411764705882353	0.030303030303030304	0.02985074126977139	0.12280701754385964	0.1590909090909091	0.1386138564689738	0.7974059581756592	0.7492958903312683	0.7726026177406311	0.0	0.19350811485642946
11840	At his own request, he lived at an asylum there from May 1889 through May 1890 painting the gardens of the asylum and, when he had permission to venture outside its walls, nearby olive trees, cypresses and wheat fields. One painting, Olive Trees in a Mountainous Landscape, was a complement to The Starry Night. The olive tree paintings had special significance for van Gogh.	The painting depicts a lush green field with a few trees scattered throughout. The sky is filled with clouds, creating a dramatic backdrop for the scene. The field is situated in front of a mountain range, adding to the picturesque quality of the painting. The overall atmosphere of the painting is serene and peaceful, inviting the viewer to appreciate the beauty of nature.	0.16363636363636364	0.21428571428571427	0.18556700539908613	0.015873015873015872	0.016666666666666666	0.01626015760460197	0.16363636363636364	0.21428571428571427	0.18556700539908613	0.7798445820808411	0.7251442074775696	0.7515003085136414	0.0	0.17193947730398898
11961	Here he is portrayed in a highly sculpted manner with a near-expressionless, uncommunicative face, and an immobile, lifeless body. While his skin is rendered with pearly white paint, giving the surface a lively sheen or glow, this contrasts with his black, severely cropped hair and dark clothes, while his eyes are only black hollows.	The image features a young boy wearing a tie and sitting on a chair. He is looking at the camera, possibly posing for a portrait. The boy is the main focus of the scene, and the chair he is sitting on is positioned in the foreground.	0.13043478260869565	0.2	0.15789473206371207	0.018867924528301886	0.022727272727272728	0.02061855174407601	0.13043478260869565	0.2	0.15789473206371207	0.7502648830413818	0.740054726600647	0.7451248168945312	0.0	0.1522362965210356
12092	Nature seemed especially meaningful to him, trees, the landscape, even caterpillars as representative of the opportunity for transformation and budding flowers symbolizing the cycle of life. Works of the interior of the hospital convey the isolation and sadness that he felt. From the window of his cell he saw an enclosed wheat field, the subject of many paintings made from his room. Within the grounds he also made paintings that were interpretations of some of his favorite paintings by artists that he admired.	The painting depicts a man standing under a tree, looking at a building. The man is wearing a hat and appears to be observing the scene. The building has a balcony and a clock, adding to the architectural details of the scene. The painting captures the man's attention and curiosity towards the building.	0.07017543859649122	0.12121212121212122	0.08888888424444467	0.01282051282051282	0.02040816326530612	0.015748026756774936	0.07017543859649122	0.12121212121212122	0.08888888424444467	0.7591092586517334	0.7414391040802002	0.7501701712608337	0.0	0.13083048919226395
12193	Skull of a Skeleton with Burning Cigarette (Dutch: Kop van een skelet met brandende sigaret) is an early work by Vincent van Gogh. The small and undated oil-on-canvas painting featuring a skeleton and cigarette is part of the permanent collection of the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam.	The image features a skeleton with a cigarette in its mouth, sitting in a dark room. The skeleton is holding a cigarette in its hand, and it appears to be enjoying the smoke. The room is dimly lit, creating a moody atmosphere.	0.23076923076923078	0.3103448275862069	0.2647058774610727	0.022222222222222223	0.02631578947368421	0.02409638057773364	0.1794871794871795	0.2413793103448276	0.20588234804930808	0.7410987019538879	0.6490610241889954	0.6920331120491028	0.0	0.1921219924358252
12194	Still Life with Straw Hat (Stillleben mit gelbem Strohhut) also known as Still Life with Yellow Straw Hat and Still Life with Hat and Pipe was painted by Vincent van Gogh in late November - mid-December 1881 or possibly in 1885 in the town of Nuenen.	The image features a table with a variety of items on it. There is a hat, a bowl, a cup, and a spoon. The hat is placed on the table, and the bowl is positioned nearby. The cup is located towards the right side of the table, and the spoon is placed on the left side. The table appears to be a dining table, and the items suggest a meal or a gathering.	0.14705882352941177	0.1282051282051282	0.13698629639331975	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.11764705882352941	0.10256410256410256	0.10958903611934719	0.6827226877212524	0.6524295210838318	0.6672324538230896	0.0	0.08571428571428573
12196	It depicts a busy street scene in Paris, with most of the people depicted using umbrellas against the rain. To the right, a mother looks down at her daughters, each fashionably dressed in the styles of 1881 for the afternoon promenade. She largely conceals a female figure at the centre of the frame, caught in the act of raising or lowering her umbrella, suggesting that the rain is about to start or stop. The principal female figure to the left of the frame, a milliner's assistant or modiste modelled by Renoir's lover and frequent subject Suzanne Valadon, holds up her skirt against the mud and water on the road as she carries a hatbox, but has no hat, raincoat or umbrella. A vigorous young bearded gentleman seems to be about to engage her, perhaps to offer her shelter under his umbrella. She, and one of the two girls to the right with a hoop and stick, look out at the viewer, while most of the other people go about their business. Unconventionally, the focus of the painting is not at its centre, and many of the figures are cut off by the frame as if the painting were a photograph. The composition appears natural, but the angles of the umbrellas are carefully arranged to form geometric shapes, with the main figure's bandbox and the girl's hoop adding rounded elements. The colours are largely blues and greys: a pattern of umbrella canopies across the top of the painting, and the dresses and coats of the people lower down.	The image is a painting of a crowd of people walking down a street. Among the crowd, there is a woman holding a basket, and a little girl is walking beside her. The woman is wearing a long dress, and the little girl is wearing a dress as well. The painting captures the essence of a busy street scene with people carrying umbrellas, handbags, and a baby carriage.	0.09554140127388536	0.38461538461538464	0.1530612213020617	0.01702127659574468	0.06666666666666667	0.027118640827348852	0.08917197452229299	0.358974358974359	0.14285713966940866	0.8323732614517212	0.7488635778427124	0.7884131669998169	0.0037343631347967147	0.10786443119699855
12198	It includes self-portraits, portraits of him by other artists, and photographs, one of which is dubious. Most probably, van Gogh's self-portraits are depicting the face as it appeared in the mirror he used to reproduce his face, i.e. his right side in the image is in reality the left side of his face.	The image features a man with a beard and mustache, wearing a black jacket. He is looking directly at the camera, with a focused expression. The man's beard is red, and his eyes are open, creating a striking visual effect. The overall atmosphere of the image is intense and captivating.	0.16666666666666666	0.19444444444444445	0.1794871745167654	0.038461538461538464	0.041666666666666664	0.039999995008000624	0.14285714285714285	0.16666666666666666	0.1538461488757398	0.7633944749832153	0.7240924835205078	0.7432243227958679	0.0	0.19335016556595627
12244	Waiting is an empathetic example, depicting a ballerina accompanied by her chaperone, bent over ostensibly to massage her foot but whose body language indicates a person racked with anticipation before she takes stage. The background is formed from a wide variety of oranges, browns and blacks, while the younger woman is portrayed in pink, blue, and creamy tones which highlight her softness compared to the severity of the older woman. His removal from the moment reflected in the image is highlighted by the unusually steep perspective; the viewer seems to be positioned far above the two women; looking down as if seated in a box above the auditorium. Degas was aware from an early point in his studies of the exhaustion of the girls, and the extent to which they pushed the limits of their bodies for fleeting moments of elegance. He was further conscious of the brevity of a ballerina's career, and the positioning of the older chaperone–more than likely an ex-dancer herself–in this work adds to its poignancy; the younger woman representing what her forlorn looking companion once was. Degas, mindful of this, presents an interesting irony - while the young woman waits to make her entrance the older woman waits for her to leave. The tip of the chaperone's umbrella points in the direction the dancer must take; towards the stage and away from her guardian.	The image features two women, one of whom is a ballerina, sitting on the floor. The ballerina is wearing a tutu and is holding a pair of ballet shoes. The other woman is holding an umbrella, possibly to shield herself from the elements. The scene appears to be set in a room with a chair visible in the background.	0.11643835616438356	0.3953488372093023	0.17989417637916075	0.023474178403755867	0.08771929824561403	0.03703703370617314	0.10273972602739725	0.3488372093023256	0.1587301552151396	0.8073843717575073	0.7242118120193481	0.763539731502533	0.0	0.11299979091532923
12292	The work, which measures 158.7 centimetres (62.5 in) in height by 92.7 centimetres (36.5 in) wide, was undertaken in 1880 and depicts Jane Morris posed in a seated position on the bough of a sycamore tree. A small stem of honeysuckle is in her hand, a token of love in the Victorian era, that may be an indication of the secret affair the artist was immersed in with her at the time. A small stem of honeysuckle is in her hand, a token of love in the Victorian era and may be an indication of the secret affair the artist was immersed in with her at the time. the model is pictured full length. The scene is a representation of a young woman in a green silk dress, shaded by the arabesque of the winged sycamore tree's leaves. Above her head and around her the tree branches are depicted  almost embracing her, or as if she was emerging from the tree itself, almost as a dryad, or tree nymph. She is portrayed clad all in green, her dress is a romantic wide and loose silk robe,  flowing in graceful folds down, blending in with the tree's leaves, that connects the subject and its surroundings visually. She is immersed in her day dreams, turning her gaze downwards, away, towards something unseen or perhaps only perceived by her. The depiction of the young, elegant woman in her shelter surrounded by the branches, is adding to the secretive feeling of the painting, maybe indicating the furtiveness of the affair or a clandestine meeting place. In the shelter it is dark, but around her shoulder there is light, light blue compartments against a dark green background, signalling that it is daytime.	The image features a woman sitting in a forest, surrounded by trees and flowers. She is holding a book in her hand, possibly reading or studying. The woman appears to be enjoying her time in the natural environment, surrounded by the beauty of nature.	0.10897435897435898	0.5	0.1789473654825485	0.029288702928870293	0.16666666666666666	0.04982206151441864	0.08333333333333333	0.38235294117647056	0.1368421023246538	0.8246431350708008	0.713813066482544	0.7652360200881958	0.0	0.07003838572466023

12313	The painting depicts several workers on their break in the yard of a foundry and is one of the most popular of Anshutz' paintings. Painted near Wheeling, West Virginia, it is conceived in a naturalistic style featuring realistic anatomical depictions of men and boys similar to that of Thomas Eakins, although Eakins never painted industrial subjects. Some of the figures are depicted in a classical pose, such as the man in the foreground rubbing his arm.	The image depicts a group of men working together on a project. They are standing in a line, with some of them wearing suspenders. The men are engaged in various tasks, with some of them holding hammers. The scene appears to be set in a city, with a building visible in the background.

12326	The painting shows a Jewish shopkeeper, whom the artist immortalized in another image Jewess with Lemons. The woman has poor clothing, a cap on her head, and a scarf on her shoulders. She is carrying two baskets of oranges. The background depicts the roofs of Warsaw houses. The woman's face is serious. Her highlighted cheeks and prominent wrinkles heighten the effect of sadness and helplessness, which directly emanate from her character. In contrast, there are oranges whose color is a reference to life, heat, and the southern climate.	The image features a woman standing on a balcony, holding a white cloth in her hands. She is surrounded by various baskets, some of which contain oranges. The woman appears to be in the process of folding the cloth, possibly preparing it for a task or a special occasion. The scene is set against a backdrop of buildings, creating a unique and interesting atmosphere.	0.22058823529411764	0.3	0.25423728325193923	0.03488372093023256	0.047619047619047616	0.04026845149497829	0.20588235294117646	0.28	0.2372881307095663	0.8022326827049255	0.7824382185935974	0.7922118306159973	0.0	0.18518518518518517
12332	The painting depicts Phaedra stretched out on her side in a lavishly decorated bed, one arm at supporting her head and one hanging off the edge fingering the expensive drapery. She stares out of the left side of the picture plane, her face dark and resolute, while her unkempt hair is splayed on the decorated pillow. Her pale nude body covered by a sheer white sheet contrasts with the deep red, black, and gold tones around her. Two ladies in waiting are on the right. One is standing, but crouched over slightly, and active. Her body is half out of the picture plane as she peers over at Phaedra, hands clasped as if silently imploring the woman to move. The second lady sits at Phaedra's bedside sleeping, eyes closed, head leaned back, as if resting from the exhaustion of some heavy emotion. The luxurious fabrics on the bed are scattered and slipping off, as if the bed hadn't been made for a while. On the floor sits an expensive fur rug, its golden tones reminiscent of the shield, helmet, and sword tied to a column before Phaedra's bed. The furniture and architecture are adorned with oriental designs, creating a foreign look of drama and wealth. The light source for the painting comes from outside of the picture plane on the left, contrasting with the dimly lit lantern in the background.	The image depicts a scene from ancient Greece, featuring a woman lying on a bed with a veil. She is accompanied by two other women, one of whom is sitting on the bed and the other standing nearby. The room is adorned with a mirror on the wall, and a vase can be seen placed on a surface.

12522	El Jaleo is a large painting by John Singer Sargent, depicting a Spanish Gypsy dancer performing to the accompaniment of musicians. At odds with the academic practice of carefully modulated tones, Sargent dramatized the contrast between rich blacks and the shining white skirt of the dancer, caught in the strong footlights and painted briskly so as to suggest movement. The female dancer, leaning asymmetrically, is placed to imply forward motion, from left to right across the canvas. She is wearing a large, embroidered shawl wrapped around her shoulders, illustrating common flamenco costuming. The dancer's pose, with the outstretched left arm, is a depiction of standard flamenco dance technique and style.	The image is a black and white painting of a woman dancing on a stage.

In the middle background a couple are seated outside of a cafe or bar, also deep in conversation. The couple are interested only in themselves, in contrast to the two men.

12710	Completed between 1880 and 1883, the work shows a seething, huddled mass attending the annual religious procession (crucession) carrying the famous icon Our Lady of Kursk from its home at the Korennaya Monastery to the nearby city of Kursk in western Russia. The procession is led through a dusty landscape by robed, Orthodox priests holding icons, festoons and banners over their heads. Behind them follow a crowd mostly of peasants, but ranging from beggars and cripples, police and military officers to figures from the provincial elite. Religious Procession led to controversy when first exhibited due to the icon being held by a man who appears to be drunk. At the right, burly peasants carry a platform holding the icon inside an elaborate neo-classical case; only gleams of light reflecting off the gold riza icon-cover can be made out. Lines of peasants joining hands hold back the crowd, the foremost at the left trying to stop the crippled boy breaking through the cordon with his stick. Alongside ride peasant or priest stewards and officials and police in uniform, some of the latter beating back the crowd with their riding crops. Behind the icon follow priests and better-dressed people, carrying icons in front of their chest, and an "effete, dandified and bored priest" in vestments carefully straightens his hair. There is a comic effect with a stout middle-aged woman in a yellow dress and bonnet carrying an icon behind him, who looks very like a priest in his vestments. An empty icon-case, presumably that of the icon carried by the wealthy woman behind, is carried with as much reverence as the icon itself. The hillside at right appears to have been recently cleared of timber, with fresh tree stumps. Further back another platform, holding what appears to be a circular icon, is preceded by two large banners, and behind that a large processional cross can be made out through the cloud of dust.	The image depicts a large crowd of people walking down a dirt road. The crowd is diverse, with individuals of various heights and positions. Some people are walking closer to the front of the crowd, while others are further back. The scene appears to be a gathering or a parade, with people carrying items such as a book and a handbag. The atmosphere seems lively and bustling, as the crowd moves together down the road.	0.09090909090909091	0.3673469387755102	0.14574898467373673	0.03289473684210526	0.13513513513513514	0.052910049761205086	0.08585858585858586	0.3469387755102041	0.1376518186818339	0.8034887313842773	0.7132937908172607	0.7557095289230347	0.002614593894008394	0.0921814722625377

12793	Sargent shows a woman posing in a black satin dress with jeweled straps, a dress that reveals and hides at the same time. The portrait is characterized by the pale flesh tone of the subject contrasted against a dark colored dress and background. There is an assertion and showiness in the expanse of white skin – from her high forehead down her graceful neck, shoulders, and arms. Although the black of her dress is bold, it is also deep, recessive and mysterious. She is surrounded by a rich brown which is at once luminous and dark enough to provide contrast to the skin tones. Most disconcerting is the whiteness of the skin, an overt contrivance of "aristocratic pallor"; by contrast her red ear is a jarring reminder of the color of flesh unadorned. The image's erotic suggestion is of a distinctly upper-class sort: unnaturally pale skin, cinched waist, severity of profile and an emphasis on aristocratic bone structure all imply a distant sexuality "under the professional control of the sitter", rather than offered for the viewer's delectation.	A woman in a black dress stands in front of a table, posing for a portrait. She is wearing a necklace and has her hands on her hips. The woman appears to be the main focus of the painting, with the table and other elements in the background.	0.16521739130434782	0.5277777777777778	0.2516556255076532	0.03468208092485549	0.1276595744680851	0.054545451185537386	0.14782608695652175	0.4722222222222222	0.22516555928248763	0.813105583190918	0.7269527912139893	0.7676194310188293	0.0	0.09398496240601505
12833	The work depicts several Sepoys being executed by being "Blown from a gun" in the aftermath of the Indian Rebellion of 1857.

13626	Green Wheat Field with Cypress (French: Champ de blé vert avec cyprès) is an oil on canvas painting by Dutch Post-Impressionist Vincent van Gogh. Several paintings of wheat fields with cypresses were made when van Gogh was able to leave the asylum grounds and explore the local landscape. Besides a fondness for cypresses, van Gogh had a special affinity with wheat fields; he depicted them dozens of times over the years; to Vincent they symbolized the cycle of life and death, and he found in them both solace and inspiration. In mid-June 1889, Vincent wrote to his sister Wil that he had just completed the painting: Then yet another [landscape] depicts a field of yellowing wheat surrounded by brambles and green bushes. At the end of the field a little pink house with a tall and dark cypress tree that stands out against the distant purplish and bluish hills, and against a forget-me-not blue sky streaked with pink whose pure tones contrast with the already heavy, scorched ears, whose tones are as warm as the crust of a loaf of bread."	The painting depicts a lush green field with yellow flowers, creating a serene and picturesque scene. In the background, there is a house surrounded by trees, adding to the idyllic atmosphere. The field is filled with tall grass, and a few trees can be seen scattered throughout the landscape.

13831	Painted in 1890, the year before his death, it depicts a harbor in the small French port of Gravelines. The extremely solid central bollard has the greatest density of dots, while the right side of the sky is so loosely covered that the white ground layer is visible. Although Seurat was quite faithful to the actual architecture of the harbor, to the extent that much of it is recognizable to this day, he arrayed the boats so their horizontal and vertical elements resulted in maximum visual stability. The elegant parabola of the wharf induces serenity. Comparing the final canvas to the rest of his studies reveals that, in addition to arranging the boats in a neat, calm horizontal line, Seurat also tweaked the walkway to give the channel a greater role in the composition. Thus, sea, sky, and ground occupy roughly equal proportions.	The image is a painting of a harbor with several boats docked. The boats are of various sizes and are scattered throughout the scene.

14109	The painting shows a woman with long flame-red hair kissing a man on the neck, as the couple embrace. Although others have seen in it "a man locked in a vampire's tortured embrace – her molten-red hair running along his soft bare skin," Munch himself always claimed it showed nothing more than "just a woman kissing a man on the neck".The painting was first called "Vampire" by Munch's friend, the critic Stanisław Przybyszewski.

14115	The painting is a portrait of Paul Gauguin's native wife Teha'amana during his first visit to Tahiti in 1891-1893. Danielsson thought the painting a farewell portrait, depicting Teha'amana in regal state dressed in her best churchgoing clothes and holding a plaited palm fan, a symbol of beauty. The red tiare flower she wears at her left ear signifies she is married. Charles Stuckey remarks that the two ripe mangoes, placed on a low table to Teha'amana's right, probably represented the bounty of Tahiti, if not Teha'amana's fertility herself. The idol is taken to be a representation of Hina, borrowed from Hindu sculptures presenting the life-giving gesture. As a counterfoil, the heads that hover above each of Teha'amana's shoulders are evil spirits, suggesting a dialogue between good and evil or between life and death. The glyphs behind Teha'amana's head are Rongorongo glyphs from Easter Island, although Gauguin's examples are imaginary.	The image features a woman standing in front of a painting, holding a fan.

The painting seems almost unfinished, since Vuillard left the underlying board exposed in the table, the seamstress' dress, and the wall. The interplay of those beiges, browns, and reds with the stark, flat pink of the window (a Vuillard hallmark) fills that ambiguous space with intensity. The scraps of cloth and wallpaper create patterns of color and shape as visually arresting as the subject matter.	The image features a woman sitting on a chair in a room with a bed.

His throne and surrounding court, however, present an unorthodox and extravagant profusion of architectural and vegetal elements which — while depicted in fine, realistic, even  jewel-like, detail — give the overall impression of a dream-like fantasy world. Jupiter's right foot rests on a snake biting its own tail. A frightful Hecate, with her polos and crescent moon, appears in the lower left corner. Among the other figures are a three-headed demon and several winged, angelic figures.	The image is a painting featuring a large statue of a woman, possibly a goddess, sitting on a pedestal.

14280	The painting depicts a moment from the Greek and Roman legend of the tragic youth Hylas, based on accounts by Ovid and other ancient writers, in which the enraptured Hylas is abducted by Naiads (female water nymphs) while seeking drinking water. It depicts Hylas, a male youth in classical garb, wearing a blue tunic with a red sash, and bearing a wide-necked water jar. He is bending down beside a pond in a glade of lush green foliage, reaching out towards seven young women, the water nymphs, who are emerging from the pond among the leaves and flowers of Nymphaeaceae (water lilies), including an early depiction of the yellow waterlily, Nuphar lutea). The nymphs are naked, their alabaster skin luminous in the dark but clear water, with yellow and white flowers in their auburn hair. They have very similar physical features, perhaps based on just two models. Hylas is being enticed to enter the water, from which he will not return. One of the nymph holds his wrist and elbow, a second plucks at his tunic, and a third holds out some pearls in the palm of her hand. The face of Hylas in profile is shadowed and barely visible, but the faces of the nymphs are clearly visible as they gaze upon him. The scene is depicted from a slightly elevated position, looking down at the water like Hylas, so no sky is visible. Hylas's position forces the viewer's focus onto the nymphs in the water and the lack of reference to his relationship with Hercules emphasizes that the narrative of the painting is not about Hylas narrative, but about the sinister nature of the nymphs.	The image depicts a group of naked women gathered in a body of water, possibly a lake or a pond. They are standing and sitting in the water, with some of them appearing to be in a conversation.

14332	The subject is the Pont Boieldieu, an iron bridge completed a few years before in 1885. Across the river is the Gare d'Orléans train station and the Place Carnot square. His Rouen series instead focuses on the bustle of the modern city. Pissarro deliberately sought out a view of the busy industrial section of the town, and produced a number of paintings of the view from the hotel in different light conditions and different weather.

14513	The painting (oil on canvas, 70 x 59 cm) presents an empty room in Hammershøi's 17th century apartment in the Christianshavn district of Copenhagen. The bare pannelled walls, without any furnishings or decorations, are illuminated by rays of winter sunlight shining through the window, a pattern of light and shade falling on the wooden floor. The central feature of the work is the recessed window, through which shafts of dust-filled light shine diagonally down into the greyness of the room. The overall impression is that the painting portrays a dark, silent psychological space although in fact the room was located in a busy part of the city, close to the noise of docks and factories. Indeed, the painting conveys the impression of a black and white photograph with all the intermediate greys while the dusty rays of sunlight give the room a highly poetic look. As in the paintings of the Romantic period, the window can be seen as a symbol of longing and dreaming, connecting the room's interior with the world outside, juxtaposing near and far.

14717	This highly detailed work depicts a morning scene at the Villeneuve-l'étang park, located just outside Paris in the western suburb of Marnes-la-Coquette (Seine-et-Oise), France. The artist has chosen a quiet section of the park with a view facing towards the east. Unlike works of the Neo-Impressionists or Fauves, in vogue at the time, Biva has gone to great lengths to show even the most minute details of the scene, such as leaves and petals floating on the surface of the water; overlapping blades of grass; superimposed branches and leaves of varying size indicating distance from the observer; reflecting background trees in the rippling body of water; patches of raking sunlit shimmering seemingly at random throughout carefully selected sections of the composition. This work of skillfully controlled artistry presents a dominant palette of green variously mixed and blended by the artist to form diverse tones, values and hues, contrasted only by the transpiercing light of the morning sky partly visible through the delicate foliage while bouncing off the surface of the shallows.	The image depicts a serene scene of a river surrounded by trees. The river is calm and reflects the beauty of the natural environment.

14900	The portrait shows Adele Bloch-Bauer sitting on a golden throne or chair, in front of a golden starry background. Around her neck is the same jewelled choker Klimt included in the Judith painting. She wears a tight golden dress in a triangular shape, made up of rectilinear forms. In places the dress merges into the background so much so that the museum curator Jan Thompson writes that "one comes across the model almost by accident, so enveloped is she in the thick geometric scheme". [Klimt's] gold-encrusted manner of painting".Adele's hair, face, décolletage and hands are painted in oil; they make up less than a twelfth of the work and, in Whitford's opinion, convey little about the sitter's character. O'Connor writes that the painting "seem[s] to embody femininity", and thus likens it to the Mona Lisa, while for Müller and Tatzkow, the gold gives the effect that Adele appears "melancholy and vulnerable, unapproachably aloof and yet rapt".Both the current holder of the portrait—the Neue Galerie New York—and the art historian Elana Shapira describe how the background and gown contain symbols suggestive of erotica, including triangles, eggs, shapes of eyes and almonds. Also present are decorative motifs on the theme of the letters A and B, the sitter's initials. Whitford identifies influences of the art of the Byzantine, Egypt, Mycenae and Greece, describing that "the gold is like that in Byzantine mosaics; the eyes on the dress are Egyptian, the repeated coils and whorls Mycenaean, while other decorative devices, based on the initial letters of the sitter's name, are vaguely Greek".	The image features a woman wearing a gold dress, with her hands placed on her chest. She is surrounded by a beautiful and intricate gold background, which adds to the overall elegance of the scene.

15272	The work illustrates the final meters of the Paris–Roubaix race, and portrays its 1912 winner Charles Crupelandt. Metzinger's painting is the first in Modernist art to represent a specific sporting event and its champion. In the foreground a road bicycle racer is shown in various degrees of transparency that give way to elements of the background, blurring the distinction between distances near and far. The cyclists head, for example, is almost entirely transparent, the audience composed of mosaic-like cubes is visible through the head, neck and arm, an effect reminiscent of the artists Divisionist period. Metzinger's bicycle shimmers between the unique and the multiple, as if the two merge into one. The scene represents an extant photo-finish, a series of frames captured during the final sprint at the end of a race. The presence of the other bicyclist is revealed by the rear wheel to the left of the canvas. Metzinger's painting appears to show the handlebars in two positions, but the handlebars along with sections of the bicycle frame are actually superimposed as a transparency (over the left hand, left foot of the cyclist and over the drive-wheel), representing two consecutive frames, one subtracted from the other, i.e., the road is visible 'through' the racer where the bicycle had been a fraction of a second earlier, as if to show motion through absence. Cubist elements include the reduction of the geometric schema to simplified shapes, and the juxtaposition of rotating planes to define spatial qualities, printed-paper collage, the incorporation of a granular surface and multiple perspective. Parallels with Futurism include the choice of a subject in motion (the bicyclist), the suggestion of velocity (motion blur on the wheel spokes), and the fusing of forms in a static picture plane.	A painting of a man riding a bicycle is displayed. The man is wearing a green and black striped shirt and is riding a yellow bicycle. The painting is a mix of colors and features a crowd of people in the background.	0.05172413793103448	0.36	0.0904522591096185	0.007407407407407408	0.05	0.012903223558793317	0.05172413793103448	0.36	0.0904522591096185	0.7920794486999512	0.682360053062439	0.7331373691558838	0.0	0.05125661375661376

He wears a jacket and tie. To the right is a vase with a painting of a sail boat in front of a setting sun above. To the sitters left can be seen half of a portrait in a round frame. While the Man with a Pipe is treated in an extreme form of Cubism, the two works hanging on the wall behind the sitter are not Cubist at all, albeit, they are stylized. One represents a boat with a setting or rising sun, the other, a portrait placed in a semi-circle, almost an echo of the Man with a Pipe. Rather than simultaneously superimposing successive images to depict motion, Metzinger represents the subject at rest from multiple angles.	The image is a painting of a man with a pipe in his mouth, surrounded by various other elements. The man is wearing a suit and tie, and there are multiple ties visible in the painting. The painting also features a bicycle, a chair, a clock, and a vase. The man appears to be sitting in a chair, and the bicycle is positioned in the lower left corner of the painting. The clock is located in the upper right corner, and the vase is situated in the lower right corner.	0.20408163265306123	0.4166666666666667	0.27397259832614	0.08391608391608392	0.15	0.10762331378471335	0.1836734693877551	0.375	0.24657533805216747	0.8347597122192383	0.7822714447975159	0.8076637387275696	0.04163375317461425	0.2055896691203245

15390	Painted over several summers, it depicts a nude girl or young woman standing in the shallow water of a lake, prominently lit by the morning sun. She is leaning slightly forward in an ambiguous posture, which has been read variously as a straightforward portrayal of protecting her modesty, huddling against the cold, or sponge bathing. September Morn depicts, from an oblique point of view, a naked blonde girl or young woman standing ankle-deep in the water near the shoreline of a tranquil lake surrounded by hills. The figure is backlit by the morning sun, but fully visible, if a little darker than her surroundings. Her arms are folded about her body, her right arm passing below her breasts as she grasps her left elbow, while her left arm conceals her pubic area. This pose has been variously interpreted as the subject protecting herself from the cold, covering her modesty, or sponge bathing, or as the artist's "fetishisation of innocence".Reviews in 1912 noted that the painting was dominated by grays: those of her shaded body, the blue-grays of the September water, the green-grays of the sky, and the pink-grays of the hills behind her.	The image is a painting of a woman standing in a body of water, possibly a lake. She is wearing a dress and appears to be looking down at her hands. The painting has a warm, golden tone, giving it a vintage feel. The woman is the main focus of the painting, and her position in the water adds a sense of depth and tranquility to the scene.	0.13934426229508196	0.38636363636363635	0.2048192732123676	0.03954802259887006	0.1044776119402985	0.05737704519652004	0.13114754098360656	0.36363636363636365	0.1927710804412833	0.824499249458313	0.7473019361495972	0.7840048670768738	0.0	0.12333640200430455

15438	Vertical lines, running the entire length of the canvas are intersected by diagonal lines to form rectilinear shapes of various sizes. The diagonal lines run from the top left to the bottom right and from the top right to the bottom left of the painting. These rectilinear shapes are composed of blocks of black, white, and a range of blue, red, purple, gray, and brown color. The large black space between the two clusters of the shapes, and the arching of the top of the right cluster, brings to the viewer’s mind two stained glass windows illuminated by light in a dark cathedral.	The image is a painting of a cityscape at night. The scene is set against a backdrop of a large building, possibly a skyscraper. The painting is a mix of blue and red hues, creating a vibrant atmosphere.

These men appear to be day laborers, at the docks to find work. They look to the left, as if receiving a message, while a large steam liner looms over them to their right. Behind them are a tugboat and the waters and ice floes of the harbor in winter. Further behind them are the skyscrapers of the lower Manhattan skyline. The winter weather about them is bleak and gray.	The image depicts a group of people standing on a dock next to a large boat. There are at least 12 people in the scene, some of them wearing hats. The boat is positioned in the background, taking up a significant portion of the image. The people are scattered around the dock, with some standing closer to the boat and others further away. The scene appears to be a lively gathering of people near the water.	0.24390243902439024	0.40816326530612246	0.3053435067676709	0.08571428571428572	0.1232876712328767	0.10112359066721396	0.21951219512195122	0.3673469387755102	0.27480915562263275	0.8011956810951233	0.7227445840835571	0.7599508166313171	0.04624542354379022	0.2574933716802229

15514	The work, an oil painting on canvas with dimensions of 147 cm × 89.2 cm  (57.9 in × 35.1 in) in portrait, seemingly depicts a figure demonstrating an abstract movement in its ochres and browns. The discernible "body parts" of the figure are composed of nested, conical and cylindrical abstract elements, assembled together in such a way as to suggest rhythm and convey the movement of the figure merging into itself. Dark outlines limit the contours of the body while serving as motion lines that emphasize the dynamics of the moving figure, while the accented arcs of the dotted lines seem to suggest a thrusting pelvic motion. The movement seems to be rotated counterclockwise from the upper left to the lower right corner, where the gradient of the apparently frozen sequence corresponding to the bottom right to top left dark, respectively, becomes more transparent, the fading of which is apparently intended to simulate the "older" section. At the edges of the picture, the steps are indicated in darker colors. The center of the image is an amalgam of light and dark, that becomes more piqued approaching the edges. The overall warm, monochrome bright palette ranges from yellow ochre to dark, almost black tones.	The image is a painting of a person holding a guitar. The person is surrounded by various musical instruments, including a violin, a trumpet, and a trombone. The painting is quite detailed, with the person and the instruments occupying a significant portion of the frame. The overall composition of the painting suggests a focus on the musician and their instruments.	0.08527131782945736	0.3142857142857143	0.13414633810603815	0.015544041450777202	0.05172413793103448	0.02390437891652567	0.08527131782945736	0.3142857142857143	0.13414633810603815	0.801884651184082	0.715545654296875	0.7562588453292847	0.0	0.09139839894693504
15526	The reclining figure wearing a necklace shown in the lower center of the canvas is placed next to a pedestal fruit bowl and another bird with the unmistakable coloration of the rare Scarlet ibis (L'Ibis rouge), a rich symbol for both exoticism and fashion. A mysterious pyramidal shape is seen as if through a porthole to the right of the reclining figure's head, though it remains a matter of speculation whether there exists any relation to the ibis or pyramids of ancient Egypt. In front of the pyramid appears a shape that resembles a sundial, perhaps meant as the element of time, or 'duration', as the clock placed in the upper right hand corner of his Nude of 1910.Two other birds, in addition to the blue bird and scarlet ibis can be seen in the composition, one of which resembles a green heron. A large steamship can be seen bellowing gaseous vapor from its funnel in the distant sea or ocean, and a smaller boat (or canot) is visible below. On the left half of Metzinger's L'Oiseau Bleu, holding in her right hand a yellow fan (éventail) is a sitting nude who in her left hand holds a mirror into which she gazes. In the rest of the scene, various items and divers elements are placed, including in the upper center (practically at the highest point of the painting) the Sacré-Cœur Basilica, located at the summit of the butte Montmartre, the highest point of the city.	The image is a painting of a man and a woman, both naked, with a horse in the background. The man is holding a bow and arrow, while the woman is holding a parasol. The painting is a mix of different styles and colors, creating a unique and intriguing visual experience.	0.06578947368421052	0.3225806451612903	0.10928961467228053	0.013513513513513514	0.06382978723404255	0.02230482982988111	0.05921052631578947	0.2903225806451613	0.09836065292364664	0.8051460981369019	0.7012910842895508	0.7496386766433716	0.0	0.0804912375144661
15538	Red Kimono on the Roof is a matter-of-fact depiction of a woman in a vibrant red wrap hanging laundry on a New York roof, clothespin in her mouth. This particular slice of the Lower East Side probably caught Sloan's eye due to the kimono worn by the woman, a charmingly bohemian sartorial choice that meshed well with the novel Maratta color system Sloan had just begun using on his typically sober paintings.	A woman in a red dress is hanging clothes on a clothesline. She is holding a basket of clothes and appears to be in the process of drying them. The scene takes place on a street, with a building visible in the background.	0.18333333333333332	0.34375	0.23913043024574673	0.04225352112676056	0.075	0.05405404944403903	0.18333333333333332	0.34375	0.23913043024574673	0.7759091854095459	0.7056459784507751	0.7391114234924316	0.0	0.15540540540540543

15572	In Cliff Dwellers, George Bellows captures the colorful crowd on New York City's Lower East Side, on what appears to be a hot summer day. People spill out of tenement buildings onto the streets, stoops, and fire escapes. Laundry flaps overhead and a street vendor hawks his goods from his pushcart in the midst of all the traffic. In the background, a trolley car heads toward Vesey Street.	The image is a black and white painting of a bustling city street filled with people. The crowd is diverse, with individuals of various ages and genders. Some people are standing, while others are sitting or lying down.  The street is lined with buildings, and there are several cars parked or driving along the road. A horse can be seen in the middle of the scene, adding to the urban atmosphere.

15601	Dynamism of a Cyclist (Dinamismo di un Ciclista) is a 1913 painting by Italian Futurist artist Umberto Boccioni (1882–1916) that demonstrates the Futurist preoccupation with speed, modern methods of transport, and the depiction of the dynamic sensation of movement.	The image is a painting of a blue and yellow bird, with a mix of blue, yellow, and red colors. The bird is surrounded by a vibrant and colorful background, creating a lively and dynamic scene. The painting showcases the artist's skill in capturing the bird's features and the vivid colors of the background.	0.28125	0.25	0.26470587737024226	0.10526315789473684	0.07547169811320754	0.08791208304794135	0.25	0.2222222222222222	0.23529411266435996	0.7608855962753296	0.6995353698730469	0.7289218306541443	0.0	0.21841110852291845
15611	En Canot is a large oil painting on canvas with approximate dimensions 146 cm × 114 cm (57 in × 45 in), representing an elegantly dressed woman painted in a Cubist style holding an umbrella while she sits in a canoe or small boat. Water with undulating waves or ripples and two other boats are visible in the background. The vertical composition is divided, fragmented or faceted into series of non-Euclidean spherical arcs, hyperbolic triangles, rectangles, squares, planes or surfaces delineated by contrasting form. For example, the two boats in the 'background' are smaller than the boat in the 'foreground' within which the model is sitting, consistent with classical perspective in that objects appear smaller as distance from the observer increases.

Picasso used a limited palette to draw attention to the overlapping, fragmented shapes of common objects including musical instruments, sheet music, glasses, a bottle, and a cigarette.

He also displayed great creativity in the application of the paint, using a comb to create the lines on the sheet music and the recorder's wood grain.

16005	This distilled synthetic form of Cubism exemplifies Metzinger's continued interest, in 1916, towards less surface activity, with a strong emphasis on larger, flatter, overlapping abstract planes. The role of color remains primordial, but is now restrained within sharp delineated boundaries in comparison with several earlier works. The vertical composition is painted in a geometrically Cubist style, representing a woman holding a mirror in her left hand, standing in front of a chair and dressing table upon which rests a perfume atomizer. An angled window appears to the left with an awning above, part of a tree and blue sky beyond. Her left breast is seen both from the front and from the side simultaneously. Her face is eminently stylized, her neck is tubiform, her hair almost realistic in appearance as if combed onto the canvas; her shoulders, decidedly cubic from which emanate long slender arms superimposed with geometric elements that compose the background. Blues, whites and reds dominate the composition. Greens and ochers serve to delineate elements in the foreground (arms, leg, table).	The image features a woman with a green and blue dress, standing in front of a red background. She appears to be wearing a hat and is looking down.

16606	The painting is dominated by a depiction of brown-skinned pears with the eponymous footed silver fruit bowl, which somewhat resembles a wine glass (specifically a coupe). A deliberately created optical illusion of the eponymous human face (a face which would reappear in one of Dalí's later works, The Endless Enigma) occupies the same space as the dish; the fruits suggest wavy hair, the dish's bowl becomes the forehead, the stem of the dish serves as the bridge of the nose, and the dish's foot doubles as the chin. The eyes of the large face, however, are formed by background objects lying on the sand at the edge of the strand — deeper in the image — rather than sharing form with the fruit dish. The face's right eye is what appears to be a shell, and the face's left eye a piece of a ship or boat. In the middle ground of the scene, where the sand of the beach appears to end, a small version of the fruit dish can be seen on the ground with several pears scattered near it, all to the same scale as the only embodied human figures depicted in the painting. A second iteration of the face appears further in the distance, just to the right of the elbow of the nude male figure; in the same area of the painting, two dogs are playing along a path in the distance. One of those dogs is itself an echo of the immense, illusionary figure of a dog which stretches from the left to the right margin of the painting, with the dog's collar formed by a multi-arched bridge or aqueduct in the landscape beyond.	The image is a surreal painting featuring a face with a bowl on top of it.

16740	The painting is generally described as depicting American children being tucked into bed by their parents while the Blitz rages across the Atlantic in Great Britain. The painting shows children resting safely in their beds, oblivious to the perils of this world, as their parents look on. Their mother tucks them in while their father holds a newspaper describing the horrors of the ongoing conflict. However, his attention is fully on his children and not on the alarming headlines. According to another view, the children are already asleep, and their parents are checking on them in their shared narrow bed before they themselves turn in for the night. The father appears as the "classic Rockwell onlooker" who serves as a viewer within the painting. Since he is holding his glasses, we assume that he has finished reading the Bennington Banner in his hand. The newspaper's headline reads "Bombings Ki ... Horror Hit", referencing the Blitz. In the background is a lit hallway and a stairway leading to the first floor. Painted during the bombing of London, it was supposed to say, 'Thank God we can put our children to bed with a feeling of security, knowing they will not be killed in the night.'"

16741	The work depicts a group of people gathered around a dinner table for a holiday meal. Having been partially created on Thanksgiving Day to depict the celebration, it has become an iconic representation for Americans of the Thanksgiving holiday and family holiday gatherings in general. The painting shows an aproned matriarch presenting a roasted turkey to a family of several generations, in Rockwell's idealistic presentation of family values. The patriarch looks on with fondness and approval from the head of the table, which is the central element of the painting. The table has a bowl of fruit, celery, pickles, and what appears to be cranberry sauce. There is a covered silver serving dish that would traditionally hold potatoes, according to Richard Halpern, but Bennett describes this as a covered casserole dish. The servings are less prominent than the presentation of white linen, white plates and water-filled glasses. The people in the painting are not yet eating, and the painting contrasts the empty plates and vacant space in their midst with images of overabundance.	The image depicts a large family gathered around a dining table, enjoying a meal together. There are several people sitting and standing around the table, with a total of 13 people visible in the scene. The table is set with various items, including wine glasses, cups, forks, and knives.

16902	The piece depicts a scene of "raining men", nearly identical to each other dressed in dark overcoats and bowler hats, who seem to be either falling down like rain drops, floating up like helium balloons, or just stationed in mid-air as no movement or motion is implied. The backdrop features red-roofed buildings and a mostly blue partly cloudy sky, lending credence to the theory that the men are not raining. The men are equally spaced in a lattice, facing the viewpoint and receding back in rhombic grid layers. All of these men are dressed the same, have the same bodily features and are all floating/falling. This leaves us to look at the men as a group. Magritte included a likeness of Scutenaire in the painting – his face is used for the large man by the chimney of the house on the right of the picture.	The image features a large number of people standing on the roof of a building. They are all dressed in black suits and hats, and they appear to be looking up at the sky. The sky is filled with numerous raindrops, creating a rainy atmosphere. The people are scattered across the rooftop, with some standing closer to the edges and others more centrally located. The scene captures the essence of a rainy day in the city.	0.18446601941747573	0.3584905660377358	0.24358973910338597	0.04964539007092199	0.0958904109589041	0.06542055625251145	0.17475728155339806	0.33962264150943394	0.2307692262828732	0.8291637897491455	0.7739445567131042	0.8006030917167664	0.0	0.1696020874103066
16906	That skull has been split open vertically to reveal various compartments inside. Through the eyes, nose, and mouth we can see the rest of the body lying in a wheat field. Inside the skull itself, each compartment holds a scrap of paper, representing a memory or thought. The center compartment, however, holds only a white rat, which represents Kurelek's spirit. The rat is wound up and inert, having run through the maze of the skull chewing a piece of each scrap of paper and finding it undigestible. The skull in the painting has been opened up by ribbon, to suggest the work of the doctors at the mental hospital, attempting to make a proper diagnosis. Kurelek depicted the rat spirit as inert, unwilling to leave his prison even though it has been opened up for him.	The image is a painting of a large, intricate, and detailed scene. It features a variety of elements, including people, animals, and objects. There are several people scattered throughout the painting, some of which are closer to the foreground, while others are further in the background.  In addition to the people, there are multiple animals present in the painting, such as birds and a dog. The painting also includes various objects, such as a chair, a bowl, and a clock. The combination of these elements creates a rich and complex visual experience.	0.13186813186813187	0.1935483870967742	0.1568627402776711	0.007874015748031496	0.011627906976744186	0.009389666546763473	0.13186813186813187	0.1935483870967742	0.1568627402776711	0.7714781165122986	0.7164638042449951	0.742953896522522	0.0	0.159468438538206

16948	The painting depicts the interior of an empty butcher's shop, including the eponymous butcher's block. The tools of the trade – choppers, knives and meathooks – hang from the rails. The detail of the brushwork, with its meticulous lines and opaque passages of thin paint in the background, the fine scratches incised into the block to indicate its use, and the artist’s handmade wooden frame, all converge in an exquisite synthesis  Brack's works, including The Block, were often considered to be satire of 1950s and 60s Australia.	The image is a painting of a room with a bed, a sewing machine, and a table. The bed is positioned in the center of the room, and the sewing machine is located on the right side of the room. The table is situated on the right side of the room as well. The room appears to be a workspace or a bedroom, with the sewing machine suggesting that it might be used for sewing or crafting.	0.14754098360655737	0.225	0.17821781699833364	0.047058823529411764	0.05970149253731343	0.05263157401748661	0.14754098360655737	0.225	0.17821781699833364	0.7547236680984497	0.7255270481109619	0.7398374080657959	0.0	0.16304347826086957
16950	The perspective is from below the statue's base, suggesting that the location of the viewer is set in a boat approaching the city, and emphasising the statue's massive size and height. A piece of drapery hangs around the waist of Helios and from his left arm, falling down to touch the ground behind him.	The image features a large statue of a man, possibly a god, standing on a pedestal. The statue is positioned in the center of the scene, with a group of people surrounding it. There are at least 13 people in the image, some of them standing closer to the statue while others are further away. The people appear to be admiring or interacting with the statue, creating a sense of awe and connection with the artwork.	0.1951219512195122	0.16	0.17582417087308314	0.019230769230769232	0.0136986301369863	0.015999995141121475	0.1951219512195122	0.16	0.17582417087308314	0.781934380531311	0.7734498977661133	0.7776689529418945	0.0	0.20504731861198738

16956	The figure is based on the Pope Innocent X portrait by Diego Velázquez; however, in the Bacon painting the Pope is shown as a gruesome figure and placed between two bisected halves of a cow. The carcass hanging in the background is likely derived from Rembrandt's Slaughtered Ox, 1655. In Bacon's version, animal carcasses hang at the pope's back, creating a raw and disturbing Crucifixion-like composition. The pope's hands, elegant and poised in Velázquez's version, are rough hewn and gripping the church's seat of authority in apparent terror. His mouth is held in a scream and black striations drip down from the pope's nose to his neck. The fresh meat recalls the lavish arrangements of fruits, meats and confections in 17th-century vanitas paintings, which usually carried subtle moralizing messages about the impermanence of life and the spiritual dangers of sensual pleasures.	The image features a man sitting in a chair, surrounded by two large, bloody, and raw chunks of meat. The man appears to be looking at the meat, possibly in a state of shock or disgust. The chairs are positioned in such a way that they seem to be part of a dining table, which is not visible in the image. The overall scene is quite unsettling and unusual.	0.14705882352941177	0.3	0.19736841663781177	0.029197080291970802	0.06060606060606061	0.03940886260671262	0.10784313725490197	0.22	0.14473683769044335	0.7989452481269836	0.7297154664993286	0.7627626657485962	0.0	0.13891788025889973
16957	Flag is an encaustic painting by the American artist Jasper Johns. The US flag was in the news repeatedly in 1954. The painting reflects the three colors of the US flag: red, white and blue; the flag is depicted in the form it took between 1912 and 1959, with 48 white stars on a blue canton representing the then-US states (excluding Alaska and Hawaii), and with thirteen red and white stripes.

16985	The series resembles Bacon's late 1940s and early 1950s paintings of single bust length single male figures set against anonymous flat undescribed dark backgrounds, and can thus be viewed as extensions of his "Man in Blue" paintings of a few years earlier. His lips are tightly pursed and turned downward as in Deville's cast. While his left eye is tightly shut, his right eyebrow is raised.	The image features a close-up of a person's face, with a mix of black and white colors. The face appears to be distorted, possibly due to a painting or artistic effect.

17008	The painting is a nude, depicting a woman lying on a sofa. It is not so much a question of a contrast between a skinny, awkward, black–haired woman with her small, slightly pinched features and Boucher’s plump and sensuous blonde, with her pretty, childish features and rounded proportions; it is more that Brack had engaged his whole repertoire of formal devices deliberately to destroy any trace of sensuousness.	A naked woman is lying on a couch, with her legs spread wide. She appears to be enjoying her time on the couch, possibly reading a book.

The red and black colors create a bold and striking visual effect, making the painting stand out.	0.21951219512195122	0.2	0.20930232059221213	0.019230769230769232	0.01694915254237288	0.018018013037904144	0.1951219512195122	0.17777777777777778	0.18604650663872377	0.7796497941017151	0.7692434787750244	0.774411678314209	0.0	0.21428571428571427
17028	Each canvas is painted to resemble the version of the United States flag that was in use at the time the work was painted, with 48 white stars in a blue canton on a field of thirteen alternating red and white stripes. Each flag is rendered with the approximately correct colors and proportions, as defined by Title 4 of the United States Code.	The image features a large painting of an American flag, with the flag's stars and stripes prominently displayed. The flag is depicted in a square format, with the stars and stripes arranged in a visually appealing manner.

17040	The lithograph depicts a large building roofed by a never-ending staircase. Two lines of identically dressed men appear on the staircase, one line ascending while the other descends. Two figures sit apart from the people on the endless staircase: one in a secluded courtyard, the other on a lower set of stairs. Escher developed the theme further in his print Waterfall, which appeared in 1961.The two concentric processions on the stairs use enough people to emphasise the lack of vertical rise and fall. In addition, the shortness of the tunics worn by the people makes it clear that some are stepping up and some are stepping down. By showing an unaccountable ritual of what Escher calls an 'unknown' sect, Escher has added an air of mystery to the people who ascend and descend the stairs. Therefore, the stairs themselves tend to become incorporated into that mysterious appearance. There are 'free' people and Escher said of these: 'recalcitrant individuals refuse, for the time being, to take part in the exercise of treading the stairs.	A drawing of a building with a large clock tower and a group of people on the side of the building.	0.07079646017699115	0.5333333333333333	0.12499999793090823	0.024539877300613498	0.2	0.04371584504762767	0.061946902654867256	0.4666666666666667	0.10937499793090823	0.7898988127708435	0.6735291481018066	0.727087140083313	0.0	0.0511654349061967
17042	The painting is a complex assemblage of art historical references and religious scenes emphasizing Catholic symbolism. The Ecumenical Council is an assemblage of religious scenes and other symbols with personal significance to Dalí that he often repeated in his works. At the top center of the piece is the holy trinity: a youthful Father extends an arm to cover his face and is shown without genitals. Below and to the left of God is Jesus, holding a cross. The Holy Spirit floats to the right with its face obscured while a dove flies overhead. Between Jesus and the Holy Spirit is a scene from the Papal coronation. Dalí's wife Gala is shown kneeling under this area, holding a book and a cross. Beside her are the Cap de Creus cliffs. The top and bottom portions of the composition are markedly different, as the figures above are not sharply defined and they blend into each other with sweeping clouds. The figures, rock, and water in the lower portion, in contrast, are clear and have distinct shapes and lines. The merging between the two parts of the canvas is Dalí's depiction of the marriage between heaven and earth. The top figure, commonly recognized as God the Father, is more reminiscent of a naked, suffering Christ (the study depicts the top figure with male genitalia). The lower figures are androgynous, wearing gowns and posing with traditionally feminine attributes. The lower right figure, which is recognized as the Holy Spirit by the dove over its head, has its hands crossed, a gesture associated with the Annunciation: the revelation that Mary will give birth to Christ.	The image is a painting featuring a woman in a white dress, who appears to be flying through the air. She is holding a cross in her hand. The painting also includes a man and a bird, as well as a boat and a horse. The scene is set in a cloudy sky, giving the painting a dreamy and surreal atmosphere.	0.08125	0.325	0.1299999968000001	0.01984126984126984	0.08620689655172414	0.03225806147429789	0.075	0.3	0.11999999680000008	0.7994647026062012	0.7227026224136353	0.759148120880127	0.0	0.07643085673658016

The woman is wearing a white dress and is holding her finger to her mouth. The man is standing next to her, and they appear to be engaged in a conversation. The woman is also wearing a necklace. The comic strip is written in a humorous manner, with the man asking the woman, "It's not an engagement ring, is it?"	0.14285714285714285	0.07142857142857142	0.095238090793651	0.045454545454545456	0.015151515151515152	0.022727268977273344	0.09523809523809523	0.047619047619047616	0.06349205904761936	0.7012027502059937	0.7557221055030823	0.7274423241615295	0.0	0.15290519877675843
17056	It is a painting of a man looking through a peephole. The picture teases the viewer who is given the feeling that they are in a dark room being viewed by the main subject of the painting who is a man that peeks through a hole in the door. The subject is extending a finger through a circular opening, which is a self-reference because it is representative of Lichtenstein's technique of stenciling Ben-day dots by pressing the fluid onto the painting surface through a screen with a device not too different in size and shape from a finger. However, the corporeal is depicted quite adequately in the intense phallicism and the dotted coloration of the skin. He uses the narrative to emphasize this theme, while playing on both the circular peephole and the circular eyes. The depicted mechanical device, a peephole in this case, forces the vision into a monocular format.	The image is a comic strip featuring a man with a black and white face. The man is looking into a mirror, and the reflection shows him holding a woman's face. The comic strip is titled "I Can See the Whole Room... And There's Nobody In It!"

17071	It shows a perpetual motion machine where water from the base of a waterfall appears to run downhill along the water path before reaching the top of the waterfall. The watercourse supplying the waterfall (its aqueduct or leat) has the structure of two Penrose triangles. The image depicts a watermill with an elevated aqueduct and waterwheel as the main feature. The aqueduct begins at the waterwheel and flows behind it. The walls of the aqueduct step downward, suggesting that it slopes downhill. The aqueduct turns sharply three times, first to the left, then to the right, and finally to the left again. The viewer looks down at the scene diagonally, which means that from the viewer's perspective the aqueduct appears to be slanted upward. The viewer is also looking across the scene diagonally from the lower right, which means that from the viewer's perspective the two left-hand turns are directly in line with each other, while the waterwheel, the forward turn and the end of the aqueduct are all in line. The second left-hand turn is supported by pillars from the first, while the other two corners are supported by a tower of pillars that begins at the waterwheel. The water falls off the edge of the aqueduct and over the waterwheel in an impossible infinite cycle; in his notes on the picture, Escher points out that some water must be periodically added to this perpetual motion machine to compensate for evaporation. The use of the Penrose stairs is paralleled by Escher's Ascending and Descending (1960), where instead of the flow of water, two lines of monks endlessly march uphill or downhill around the four flights of stairs. The two support towers continue above the aqueduct and are topped by two compound polyhedra, revealing Escher's interest in mathematics as an artist. The one on the left is a compound of three cubes. The one on the right is a stellation of a rhombic dodecahedron (or a compound of three non-regular octahedra) and is known as Escher's solid. Below the mill is a garden of bizarre, giant plants. This is actually a magnified view of a cluster of moss and lichen that Escher drew in ink as a study in 1942.The background seems to be a climbing expanse of terraced farmland.	The image features a large, intricate building with a clock tower and a spiral staircase. The clock tower is situated in the middle of the building, and the spiral staircase is located towards the right side of the building. The building appears to be a mix of stone and brick, giving it a unique and impressive appearance.	0.07853403141361257	0.42857142857142855	0.13274336021419067	0.02127659574468085	0.1320754716981132	0.03664921226981184	0.07329842931937172	0.4	0.12389380269206679	0.792624831199646	0.6983120441436768	0.7424854636192322	0.0	0.05948041102178474

17107	It deliberately associated animal slaughter with the crucifixion. In this work, the subjects of the three separate canvases do not seem to interact or interrelate, but they are shown with similar simple backgrounds: an orange floor joining a curved red wall which is pierced by black openings. Here, the left panel appears to show two figures in a butcher's shop with joints of meat on the counter. The centre panel is occupied by a bloodied human body writhing on a bed, with a white dot on the foot possibly a nail scar. The crucifixion is moved from its traditional place in the centre panel to the third panel, where a figure reimagined as a gutted carcass that is sliding down a cross in the right panel; its contorted form is a reference (but inverted) to Christ's body in Cimabue's 13th-century Crucifix and is also influenced by Rembrandt's Side of Beef.	The image is a triptych, featuring three different paintings of a bed. The first painting shows a bed with a person lying on it, the second painting shows a bed with a person sitting on it, and the third painting shows a bed with a person standing on it.

17142	Drowning Girl (also known as Secret Hearts or I The painting shows a teary-eyed woman on a turbulent sea. She is emotionally distressed, seemingly from a romance. Drowning Girl is a painting of a female subject who would prefer to give in to the power of the ocean than call for aid. Lichtenstein's version of the scene eliminates everything but the sea and a few body parts of the subject: her head, shoulder and hand, which are barely above the water. As her face is presented her eyes are shut with drops of what appear to be tears flowing from them. Lichtenstein cropped the image dramatically, showing the girl alone and encircled by a threatening wave. , Drowning Girl presents "a young woman who seems to have cried herself a river ... literally drowning in emotion," according to Janis Hendrickson. According to Janis Hendrickson, the subject's head appears to rest on a wave as if it were a pillow and lies in the water as if it were a bed, creating a blend of "eroticism and final resting place".	The image features a woman with blue hair, wearing a white dress, and holding her face in her hands. She appears to be crying or upset. The scene takes place in a body of water, with the woman surrounded by waves. The image is a painting, and the woman's emotions are captured in a powerful manner.	0.17796610169491525	0.5	0.262499996128125	0.024096385542168676	0.07547169811320754	0.03652967669648293	0.1694915254237288	0.47619047619047616	0.24999999612812504	0.8353044986724854	0.740852952003479	0.7852487564086914	0.0	0.15607125038308128

17187	She fills each of the small canvases, with the background reduced to areas of flat black paint. Her face is contorted to varying degrees in each, a technique reminiscent of some of Picasso's late period female portraits. In fact, the distortions of Bacon's panels are restrained by the standards of his late 60s and early 70s portraits, in which of some the sitter's faces disappears completely, replaced by eye sockets, or smears of broad paint representing caved in cheek or jaw bones. In these works, one of Moraes' eyes is enlarged and fixed squarely on the viewer as the rest of her face melts into chaos.	The image is a triptych, featuring three distinct portraits of a woman. The first portrait is on the left side, the second is in the middle, and the third is on the right side. Each portrait is painted in a different style, showcasing the artist's versatility and skill.

This large shape contains smaller, neatly outlined, puzzle-like shapes, most of which are white and filled with parallel lines. The main colors in the work are limited to red, white, blue, and black. Although the shapes are abstracted, a boat or ship and fishermen can be seen, and the title suggests they are fishing for whiting. In contrast with the foreground image, the background is dark and heavily textured with brushwork.	The image is a painting of a boat, featuring a variety of colors and patterns.

17261	The painting consists of a man in an overcoat and a bowler hat standing in front of a low wall, beyond which are the sea and a cloudy sky. The man's face is largely obscured by a hovering green apple. However, the man's eyes can be seen peeking over the edge of the apple. Another subtle feature is that the man's left arm appears to bend backwards at the elbow. At least it hides the face partly well, so you have the apparent face, the apple, hiding the visible but hidden, the face of the person.	The image features a man wearing a suit and a hat, with a green apple in his mouth. The man is standing in front of a painting, which adds a unique and artistic touch to the scene.

17292	It depicts Dyer sitting on a revolving office stool in a luridly coloured room. His body and face are contorted, and his legs are tightly crossed. His head appears to be framed within a window or door. Above him is a naked hanging lightbulb, a favourite motif of Bacon's.

A division ran right across the image, from one edge to the other like a horizon line. The painted area was framed with a band of white just over a centimetre wide. Their landscape-like qualities, with the black at the top — an Arctic wasteland under a vast and empty sky — is at the same time more deathlike.	The image is a black and white painting of a night sky. The sky is dark and void of any visible stars or other celestial objects.

17393	Menacing and terrified figures seem to “burst out of the canvas to reveal the inner realities of war”.The central painting focuses a goddess-like figure with multiple sets of arms and legs suspended in chains and barbed wire. Thick black lines dominate Kanso's work and the presence of chains and barbed wire are common as well. She is turned upside down and surrounded by chaotic mess of menacing figures, barbs, chains, and specters of death extending their devastation to the entire space of the canvas. At the bottom of the central panel, a figure with outreached arms envelopes the entire scene, as if to embrace all of the players in light. The left panels depicts two skeletons with long spines made of the redundant thick black lines, framing the section. An infant's head, wailing in sadness, serves as a backdrop, constantly reminding us of the loss of Lebanon's youth. A demonic figure reminiscent of St. Michael the Archangel floats above the victim, stabbing it with a long spear. The victim mirrors his assailant, yellow, gaunt, and sporting an identical weapon. Below the jaundiced loser of the battle is a child, weeping and shielding itself from the vision. The victims serve as sacrificial lambs to the causes of each side of the war when we see a demon eating more children in the bottom left corner. Across from the maternal figure, Kanso depicts a forest in rare form, using green.	The image features a painting of a woman with a baby, surrounded by other people.
