## Description

This repo is used for analyzing the capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) as artwork captioners.

## Research questions

### Q1: Can MLLMs provide high quality captions for paintings?

### Q2: Can MLLM generated painting captions be effective for fine-tuning?

## Data
